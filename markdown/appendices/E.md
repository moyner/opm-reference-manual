The command line syntax for running OPM Flow is:


```

flow [OPTIONS] CASENAME
```


and typing the following command from your terminal:


```

flow CASENAME
```


will start the simulator and run the case specified by CASENAME.DATA.

OPM Flow accepts command line options to control various aspects of the simulator’s run time behavior, as described in the table below.  To give a command line option use “key=value” syntax, with no spaces around the equals sign. It is also possible to put multiple options together in a parameter file. To do so, put one option on each line of the file with “.param” as the extension and pass that filename as a command line parameter to OPM Flow using:


```

flow --parameter-file=CASENAME.param
```


to instruct OPM Flow to read the parameter file.

*Table A.1: OPM Flow 2025-04 Command Line Options*


The command line syntax for running OPM Flow is:


```

flow [OPTIONS] CASENAME
```


and typing the following command from your terminal:


```

flow CASENAME
```


will start the simulator and run the case specified by CASENAME.DATA.

OPM Flow accepts command line options to control various aspects of the simulator’s run time behavior, as described in the table below.  To give a command line option use “key=value” syntax, with no spaces around the equals sign. It is also possible to put multiple options together in a parameter file. To do so, put one option on each line of the file with “.param” as the extension and pass that filename as a command line parameter to OPM Flow using:


```

flow --parameter-file=CASENAME.param
```


to instruct OPM Flow to read the parameter file.

*Table A.1: OPM Flow 2024-10 Command Line Options*


- The command line syntax for running OPM Flow is:


```

flow [OPTIONS] CASENAME
```


and typing the following command from your terminal:


```

flow CASENAME
```


will start the simulator and run the case specified by CASENAME.DATA.

OPM Flow accepts command line options to control various aspects of the simulator’s run time behavior, as described in the table below.  To give a command line option use “key=value” syntax, with no spaces around the equals sign. It is also possible to put multiple options together in a parameter file. To do so, put one option on each line of the file with “.param” as the extension and pass that filename as a command line parameter to OPM Flow using:


```

flow --parameter-file=CASENAME.param
```


to instruct OPM Flow to read the parameter file.

*Table A.3: OPM Flow 2024-04 Command Line Options*


- The command line syntax for running OPM Flow is:


```

flow [OPTIONS] CASENAME
```


and typing the following command from your terminal:


```

flow CASENAME
```


will start the simulator and run the case specified by CASENAME.DATA.

OPM Flow accepts command line options to control various aspects of the simulator’s run time behavior, as described in the table below.  To give a command line option use “key=value” syntax, with no spaces around the equals sign. It is also possible to put multiple options together in a parameter file. To do so, put one option on each line of the file with “.param” as the extension and pass that filename as a command line parameter to OPM Flow using:


```

flow --parameter-file=CASENAME.param
```


to instruct OPM Flow to read the parameter file.

| 163 | -update-equations-scaling | A boolean value that switches on (true) or off (false) the updating of the scaling factors for mass balance equations during the simulation. | false |
| 164 | --use-average-density-ms-wells | A boolean value that specifies whether to approximate segment densitities by averaging over the segment and its outlet (true) or not (false). | false |
| 165 | --use-gmres | A boolean value that when set to true OPM Flow will use Generalized Minimal Residual (“GMRES”)^[Y. Saad, A flexible inner-outer preconditioned GMRES algorithm, SIAM J. Sci. Statist. Comput.,14, (1993).] and ^[Y. Saad and M.H. Schultz, GMRES: A generalized minimum residual algorithm for solving nonsymmetric linear systems, SIAM J. Sci. Statist.

| 166 | --use-multisegment-well | A boolean value that when set to true the simulator will use the well model for multi-segment wells instead of the one for single-segment wells. | true |
| 167 | --use-update-stabilization | A boolean value that switches on (true) or off (false) the stabilized Newton option, that attempts to detect and correct oscillations or stagnation during the Newton iterations. This option may improve convergence for some cases. | true |
| 168 | --water-only-threshold | A real positive value that defines the saturation threshold, for which cells with water saturations above or equal to this threshold are considered one-phase water only. | 1.0 |
| 169 | --zoltan-imbalance-tol | A real positive value that defines the tolerable imbalance of the load balancing provided by Zoltan package. | 1.1 |
| 170 | --zoltan-params | A character string that specifies the configuration of the Zoltan partitioner. Valid options are: graph, hypergraph or scotch. Alternatively, you can request a configuration to be read from a JSON file by giving the filename here, ending with '.json.' See https://sandialabs.github.io/Zoltan/ug_html/ug.html for available Zoltan options. | "graph" |

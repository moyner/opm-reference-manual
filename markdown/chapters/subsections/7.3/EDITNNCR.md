#### Description

[EDITNNCR](#__RefHeading___Toc140002_2545341761) enables Non-Neighbor Connections (“NNC”), entered via the [NNC](#__RefHeading___Toc63285_718313858) keyword or calculated by the simulator, to be reset to a user defined value.  Only previously defined [NNC](#__RefHeading___Toc63285_718313858)’s entered via the [NNC](#__RefHeading___Toc63285_718313858) keyword or calculated by the simulator can be edited, otherwise a warning message will be printed.  See also the [EDITNNC](#__RefHeading___Toc89569_718313858) keyword in the [EDIT](#__RefHeading___Toc40641_784232322) section that scales an existing [NNC](#__RefHeading___Toc63285_718313858).

| 7 | TRANSNNC | TRANSNNC is a positive real number greater than or equal to zero that defines the transmissibility between the first grid block (I1, J1, K1) and the second grid block (I2, J2, K2). This value cannot be defaulted and must be defined. | None |
| cP.rb/day/psia | cP.rm3/day/bars | cP.rcc/hr/atm |  |
| 8 | ISATNUM1 | ISATNUM1 is a positive integer defining which saturation table number (relative permeability table) to be used for flow from the first grid block to the second grid block. The default value of zero means the existing saturation table allocated to the upstream cell (I1,J1,K1). | 0 |
| 9 | ISATNUM2 | ISATNUM2 is a positive integer defining which saturation table number (relative permeability table) to be used for flow from the second grid block to the first grid block. The default value of zero means the existing saturation table allocated to the downstream cell  (I2,J2,K2). | 0 |
| 10 | IPRSNUM1 | IPRSNUM1 is a positive integer defining which pressure table number (PVT table) to be used for flow from the first grid block to the second grid block. The default value of zero means the existing PVT table allocated to the upstream cell (I1,J1,K1). | 0 |
| 11 | IPRSNUM2 | IPRSNUM2 is a positive integer defining which pressure table number (PVT table) to be used for flow from the second grid block to the first grid block. The default value of zero means the existing PVT table allocated to the downstream cell (I2,J2,K2). | 0 |
| 12 | FACE1 | FACE1 is a character string that defines the face associated with flow from the first grid block to the second grid block, where FACE1 can have vales of: X+, X-, Y+, Y-, Z+,  or Z-. | None |

| 14 | DIFFNNC | DIFFNNC is a positive real number greater than or equal to zero that scales the diffusivity between the first grid block (I1, J1, K1) and the second grid block (I2, J2, K2). The default value is the value calculated in the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) section. | 1* |

*Table 7.4: EDITNNCR Keyword Description*


Note that although items (8) to (14) for this keyword are not available in OPM Flow, even if they were, it is strongly recommended that these items are defaulted if the data is being entered manually, as opposed to being generated by pre-processing software.

If the transmissibility across a fault needs to be modified see the [FAULTS](#__RefHeading___Toc45779_719036256) and [MULTFLT](#__RefHeading___Toc90875_3218818441) keywords in the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) section for an alternative and less complicated method to modifying fault transmissibilities.  Transmissibility between reservoir regions can be modified by using [MULTREGT](#__RefHeading___Toc296621_1576177388) keyword, provided [MULTNUM](#__RefHeading___Toc61329_2752266063) has been used to define the inter-region transmissibility region numbers for each grid block. Finally, the [MULTX](#__RefHeading___Toc80283_1778172979), [MULTY](#__RefHeading___Toc80287_1778172979) and [MULTZ](#__RefHeading___Toc80291_1778172979) series of keywords can be used to modify transmissibility between various cells. All the aforementioned keywords are described in the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) section.


#### Example


```
--
--       MANUALLY RESET NON-NEIGHBOR CONNECTIONS
--
--       ------------ BOX -----------   -- TRANSNNC --
--       I1   J1   K1    I2   J2   K2
EDITNCCR
         1    1    1     1    1    2        0.2500    / RESET NNC TRANS FOR FAULT
         1    1    2     1    1    3        0.2500    / RESET NNC TRANS FAULT
         1    1    3     1    1    4        0.2500    / RESET NNC TRANS FAULT
/

```

The above example res-sets the transmissibility between cells (1, 1, 1) and (1, 1, 2), (1, 1, 2) and (1, 1, 3) and (1, 1, 3) and (1, 1, 4) to be 0.2500.

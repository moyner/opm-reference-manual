#### Description

[EDITNNC](#__RefHeading___Toc89569_718313858) enables Non-Neighbor Connections (“NNC”), entered via the [NNC](#__RefHeading___Toc63285_718313858) keyword or calculated by the simulator, to be multiplied (re-scaled) by a constant.  For example, if the existing transmissibility between non-neighbor connections is Told and the multiplier is C, then the resulting transmissibility, Tnew, will be .  Only previously defined [NNC](#__RefHeading___Toc63285_718313858)’s entered via the [NNC](#__RefHeading___Toc63285_718313858) keyword or calculated by the simulator can be edited, otherwise a warning message will be printed.

| 7 | TRANSMUL | TRANSMUL is a positive real number greater than or equal to zero that defines a constant that scales the transmissibility between the first grid block (I1, J1, K1) and the second grid block (I2, J2, K2). The default value of one means no scaling will be applied. | 1 |

*Table 7.3: EDITNNC Keyword Description*


Note that although items (8) to (14) for this keyword are not available in OPM Flow, even if they were, it is strongly recommended that these items are defaulted if the data is being entered manually, as opposed to being generated by pre-processing software.

Care should be taken that cells in different [PVTNUM](#__RefHeading___Toc68366_2752266063) regions (see the [PVTNUM](#__RefHeading___Toc68366_2752266063) keyword in the [REGIONS](#__RefHeading___Toc40648_784232322) section) are not connected, since the fluid properties are associated with a cell. If for example, a rbbl or a rm3 of oil flows from [PVTNUM](#__RefHeading___Toc68366_2752266063) region 1 to [PVTNUM](#__RefHeading___Toc68366_2752266063) region 2,  then the oil properties of that oil will change from the PVT 1 data set to the PVT data set 2.  This will result in material balance errors, that may or may not cause numerical issues.

If the transmissibility across a fault needs to be modified see the [FAULTS](#__RefHeading___Toc45779_719036256) and [MULTFLT](#__RefHeading___Toc90875_3218818441) keywords in the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) section for an alternative and less complicated method to modifying fault transmissibilities.  Transmissibility between reservoir regions can be modified by using [MULTREGT](#__RefHeading___Toc296621_1576177388) keyword, provided [MULTNUM](#__RefHeading___Toc61329_2752266063) has been used to define the inter-region transmissibility region numbers for each grid block. Finally, the [MULTX](#__RefHeading___Toc80283_1778172979), [MULTY](#__RefHeading___Toc80287_1778172979) and [MULTZ](#__RefHeading___Toc80291_1778172979) series of keywords can be used to modify transmissibility between various cells. All the aforementioned keywords are described in the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) section.

See also the [EDITNNCR](#__RefHeading___Toc140002_2545341761) keyword in the [EDIT](#__RefHeading___Toc40641_784232322) section that resets an existing [NNC](#__RefHeading___Toc63285_718313858) to a user defined value.


#### Example


```
--
--       MANUALLY RESCALE NON-NEIGHBOR CONNECTIONS
--
--       ------------ BOX -----------   -- TRANSMUL --
--       I1   J1   K1    I2   J2   K2
EDITNCC
         1    1    1     1    1    2        0.2000     / SET NNC FOR FAULT
         1    1    2     1    1    3        0.2000     / SET NNC FOR FAULT
         1    1    3     1    1    4        0.2000     / SET NNC FOR FAULT
/

```

The above example multiplies the transmissibility between cells (1, 1, 1) and (1, 1, 2), (1, 1, 2) and (1, 1, 3) and finally between (1, 1, 3) and (1, 1, 4) by 0.200.

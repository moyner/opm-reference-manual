#### Description

TRANR defines the transmissibility in the +R direction for all the cells in the model via an array. The keyword can only be used with Radial Grid geometry grids. The keyword effectively overwrites previously entered and calculated data. The transmissibility overwritten is the +R face transmissibility of each grid block, that is for cell (I, J, K) the transmissibility between cells  (I, J, K)  and (I+1, J, K).

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

| 1 | TRANR | TRANR is an array of real positive numbers assigning the transmissibility in the R direction to each cell in the model. Repeat counts may be used, for example 20*100.0. | None |

See also the [TRANTHT](#kw-TRANTHT) and TRANYZ keywords to modify the transmissibilities in the other directions.


#### Example


```
--
--       DEFINE INPUT BOX FOR EDITING INPUT ARRAYS
--
--       ---------- BOX ---------
--       I1  I2   J1  J2   K1  K2
BOX
         1   1    10  10   1  120                         / DEFINE BOX AREA
--
--       SET TRANR+ TRANSMISSIBILITY
--
TRANR
         120*0.00                                         /
--
--       DEFINE END OF INPUT BOX EDITING OF INPUT ARRAYS
--
ENDBOX
```

Here the [BOX](#kw-BOX) statement is used to define the input grid for the TRANR keyword, which overwrites the transmissibility previously calculated with transmissibility values of zero, resulting in a no-flow boundary in that part of the grid. The [ENDBOX](#kw-ENDBOX) keyword resets the input box to the full grid.

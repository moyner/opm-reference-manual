| 1 | PORO | PORO is an array of real positive numbers that are greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to one that are the porosity values for each cell in the model. Repeat counts may be used, for example 3000*0.15 | None |
| dimensionless | dimensionless | dimensionless |  |

#### Example


```
--
--    DEFINE GRID BLOCK POROSITY DATA FOR ALL CELLS (BASED ON NX x NY x NZ = 300)
--
PORO
      300*0.300                                                                 /

```

The above example defines a constant porosity of 0.300 to all 300 cells in the model as defined by the DIMENS keyword in the RUNSPEC section.

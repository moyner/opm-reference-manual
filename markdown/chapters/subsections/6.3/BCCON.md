### BCCON – Define Boundary Conditions Connections


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The [BCCON](#REF_HEADING_KEYWORD_BCCON) keyword defines the grid connections for the boundary conditions.

Together the [BCCON](#REF_HEADING_KEYWORD_BCCON) and [BCPROP](#REF_HEADING_KEYWORD_BCPROP) keywords define the boundary conditions for the model, and can be used to set boundary conditions for when external influx or efflux volumes are influencing the reservoir pressure and production history. For example, when the average reservoir pressure remains constant throughout the production period due to water influx, or gas migration from an external source.

This is an OPM Flow specific keyword and will therefore cause an error in the commercial simulator.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | Metric | Laboratory |  |
| 1 | INDEX | A positive integer that identifies the boundary condition. | None |
| 2 | I1 | A positive integer that defines the lower bound of the grid in the I-direction for which the boundary conditions are to be applied, must be greater than or equal 1 and less than or equal to I2 and NX. | 1 |
| 2 | I2 | A positive integer that defines the upper bound of the grid in the I-direction for which the boundary conditions are to be applied, must be greater than or equal to II and less than or equal to NX | NX |
| 3 | J1 | A positive integer that defines the lower bound of the grid in the J-direction for which the boundary conditions are to be applied, must be greater than or equal 1 and less than or equal to J2 and NY. | 1 |
| 4 | J2 | A positive integer that defines the upper bound of the grid in the J-direction for which the boundary conditions are to be applied, must be greater than or equal to JI and less than or equal to NY. | NY |
| 5 | K1 | A positive integer that defines the lower bound of the grid in the K-direction for which the boundary conditions are to be applied, must be greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to K2 and NZ. | 1 |
| 6 | K2 | A positive integer that defines the upper bound of the grid in the K-direction for which the boundary conditions are to be applied, must be greater than or equal to KI and less than or equal to NZ. | NZ |
| 7 | DIRECT | A character string that defines the direction to apply the boundary conditions, and should be set to one of the following X, Y, or Z for the positive direction, or X-, Y- or Z- for the negative direction. | None |

*Table 6.3.12.1: BCCON Keyword Description*


See also the AQUFLUX keyword that is supported by OPM Flow in both the SOLUTION and SCHEDULE sections, to define a constant flux analytical aquifer.


If the [BCCON](#REF_HEADING_KEYWORD_BCCON) and [BCPROP](#REF_HEADING_KEYWORD_BCPROP) keywords are not present in the input deck, then the boundary conditions for the model are set to be no flow, which is the normal behavior in both OPM Flow and the commercial simulator.

The BC keyword has been replaced by the [BCCON](#REF_HEADING_KEYWORD_BCCON) and [BCPROP](#REF_HEADING_KEYWORD_BCPROP) keywords.


#### Examples

The first example shows how to set a constant pressure boundary using TYPE equal to FREE:


```
--
--       DEFINE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS CONNECTION (OPM FLOW GRID KEYWORD)
--
--INDEX  ---------- BOX ---------   BC
--       I1  I2   J1  J2   K1  K2   DIRC
BCCON
1        1   1    1   1*   1   1*   X-    /
2        1   1*   1   1    1   1*   Y     /
/

--
--       DEFINE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS PROPERTIES (OPM FLOW SCHEDULE KEYWORD)
--
--INDEX  BC         BC     BC    BC     BC
--       TYPE       PHASE  RATE  PRESS  TEMP
BCPROP
1        FREE       1*     1*    1*     1*    /
2        FREE                                 /
/

```

With this option it is only necessary to define the boundary cells and all the other parameters (COMPONENT, RATE, PRESS, and TEMP) can be defaulted, as they are ignored when TYPE equals FREE.

The next example is based on NX, NY and NZ equal to 20, 1, 10 respectively, on the DIMENS keyword in the RUNSPEC section,  and shows how different boundary types can be assigned to different parts of the model.

BCCON
1        1   1    1   1    1   10   X-    /
2        20  20   1   1    1   10   X     /
/

--
--       DEFINE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS PROPERTIES (OPM FLOW SCHEDULE KEYWORD)

--INDEX  BC         BC     BC    BC     BC
--       TYPE       PHASE  RATE  PRESS  TEMP
BCPROP
1        DIRICHLET       GAS    1*    256.0  100.0 /
2        FREE       4*                        /
/

```

The last example shows how the DIRICHLET boundary condition option may be used:


```
--
--       DEFINE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS CONNECTION (OPM FLOW GRID KEYWORD)
--
--INDEX  ---------- BOX ---------   BC
--       I1  I2   J1  J2   K1  K2   DIRC
BCCON
1        1   1    1   1*   1   1*   X-    /
2        1   1*   1   1    1   1*   Y     /
/

--
--       DEFINE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS PROPERTIES (OPM FLOW SCHEDULE KEYWORD)
--
--INDEX  BC         BC     BC    BC     BC
--       TYPE       PHASE  RATE  PRESS  TEMP
BCPROP
1        DIRICHLET  WAT    1*    256.0  100.0 /
2        DIRICHLET  WAT    1*    1*     100.0 /
/

```

Here, the first line sets both the pressure and temperature at the boundary, and the second line defaults the pressure entry, so that the simulator calculated initial boundary pressure will be used.

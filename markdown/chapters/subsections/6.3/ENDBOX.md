### ENDBOX – Define the End of the BOX Defined Grid


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

This keyword marks the end of a previously defined BOX sub-grid as defined by a previously entered BOX keyword. The keyword resets the input grid to be the full grid as defined by the NX, NY, and NZ variables on the DIMENS keyword in the RUNSPEC section.

There is no data required for this keyword.


#### Example


```
--
--       DEFINE INPUT BOX FOR EDITING INPUT ARRAYS
--
--       ---------- BOX ---------
--       I1  I2   J1  J2   K1  K2
BOX
         10  10   1   6    1   1                           / DEFINE BOX AREA
--
--
--       DEFINE GRID BLOCK PERMZ DATA FOR THE INPUT BOX
--
PERMZ
         6*0.01                                            /
--
--       DEFINE END OF INPUT BOX EDITING OF INPUT ARRAYS
--
ENDBOX
```


The above example defines a subset of the grid and sets the cells PERMZ values to 0.01 for that area. After which the ENDBOX keyword resets the input to be the full grid.


| Note It is good practice to always use the ENDBOX keyword to reset the input back to the full grid when all the modifications for a sub-grid have been completed. |

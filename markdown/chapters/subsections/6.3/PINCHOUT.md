#### Description

The [PINCHOUT](#__RefHeading___Toc769617_2928331029) keyword activates the generation of Non-Neighbor Connections (“NNCs”) in the vertical (K) direction due to layers pinching out, using a constant threshold thickness of 0.001 for all unit systems.  See also the [PINCH](#__RefHeading___Toc74261_2479612490) keyword in the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) section that allows for specifying the threshold thickness and other parameters on a layer basis, and the [PINCHREG](#__RefHeading___Toc74567_718313858) keyword that applies the pinch-out controls to various regions in the model defined by the [PINCHNUM](#__RefHeading___Toc74565_718313858) keyword.

There is no data required for this keyword and there is no terminating “/” for this keyword.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.


#### Example

The example will create NNCs between the cells above and below any cell having vertical thickness less than 0.001 in either feet or metres.


```
--
--       SET PINCH-OUT CRITERA WITH CONSTANT THRESHOLD THICKNESS OF 0.001
--
PINCHOUT

```

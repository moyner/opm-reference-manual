#### Description

The [REFINE](#__RefHeading___Toc126224_332691817) keyword defines the start of a Cartesian or radial Local Grid Refinement (“LGR”) definition that sets the properties of the selected [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650). The keyword is then followed by the property keywords associated with the section where the keyword is being invoked. For example, if the [REFINE](#__RefHeading___Toc126224_332691817) keyword is used in the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) section then most of the keywords in that section can be used to set the grid properties for the [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650).

The [ENDFIN](#__RefHeading___Toc111797_332691817) keyword is used to terminate the [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) definition.

There is no data required for this keyword.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

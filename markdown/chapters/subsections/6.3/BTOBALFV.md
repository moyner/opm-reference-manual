#### Description

The [BTOBALFV](#__RefHeading___Toc162093_289573908) keyword defines a dual porosity matrix to fracture multiplier that is applied to individual cells, for when the Dual Porosity model has been invoked by either the [DUALPORO](#__RefHeading___Toc241173_1772380413) or the [DUALPERM](#__RefHeading___Toc241171_1772380413) keywords in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section.

See also the BTOBALFAV keyword in the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) section that applies a constant multiplier to all cells.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

| 1 | DZNET | DZNET is an array of real numbers describing the net thickness in the Z direction for each cell in the model. Repeat counts may be used, for example 10*100.0. If the value for a grid block is not defined then the grid block size (DZ) is assigned to the missing values. | DZ |

See also the DX, DY, DZ, NTG and TOPS keywords to fully define a Cartesian Regular Grid.


#### Example


```
--
--       DEFINE GRID BLOCK Z DIRECTION NET THICKNESS(BASED ON NX x NY x NZ = 300)
--
DZNET
         100*15.0   100*25.0   00*45.0                                          /

```

The above example defines the net thickness of the cells in the Z direction based on 300 cells in the model as defined by the DIMENS keyword in the RUNSPEC section.

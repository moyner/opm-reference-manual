#### Description

[HMMULTFT](#__RefHeading___Toc219832_373485663) defines the history match fault transmissibility gradient cumulative multipliers to be applied to the fault transmissibilities for faults declared by the FAULT keyword in the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) section, for when the History Match Gradient option has been activated by the [HMDIMS](#__RefHeading___Toc207753_4219267791) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section.  The keyword allows for the re-scaling of the existing fault transmissibilities calculated by OPM Flow, or if the [MULTFLT](#__RefHeading___Toc90875_3218818441) keyword has been entered, then [HMMULTFT](#__RefHeading___Toc219832_373485663) is applied to the existing [MULTFLT](#__RefHeading___Toc90875_3218818441) multipliers.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

#### Description

The ADD keyword adds a constant to a specified array or part of an array. The constant can be an integer or real value depending on the array type; however, the arrays that can be operated on are dependent on which section the ADD keyword is being applied in.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | :------ | --- |
| 1 | ARRAY | A character string of up to eight characters in length that defines the keyword identifying the property to be modified. | None |
| 2 | CONSTANT | An integer or real value to be added to the ARRAY in the same units as the ARRAY property. | 0 |
| 3 | I1 | A positive integer that defines the lower bound of the array in the I-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal 1 and less than or equal to I2 and NX. | 1 |
| 4 | I2 | A positive integer that defines the upper bound of the array in the I-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal to II and less than or equal to NX | NX |
| 5 | J1 | A positive integer that defines the lower bound of the array in the J-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal 1 and less than or equal to J2 and NY. | 1 |
| 6 | J2 | A positive integer that defines the upper bound of the array in the J-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal to JI and less than or equal to NY. | NY |
| 7 | K1 | A positive integer that defines the lower bound of the array in the K-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to K2 and NZ. | 1 |
| 8 | K2 | A positive integer that defines the upper bound of the array in the K-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal to KI and less than or equal to NZ. | NZ |

: ADD Keyword Applicable Arrays by Section {#tbl-6-4}
#### Example


```
--
--       ARRAY      CONSTANT     ---------- BOX ---------
--                                I1  I2   J1  J2   K1  K2
ADD
         PERMX      20.000        1*  1*   1*  1*   1*  1* / ADD 20 mD TO PERMX
/
```


The above example adds 20 md to the [PERMX](#kw-PERMX) property array throughout the model.

### HEATCR – Define Reservoir Rock Heat Capacity for All Cells


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The HEATCR keyword defines the reservoir rock volumetric heat capacity for all cells for when OPM Flow’s thermal calculation is activated by the THERMAL keywords in the RUNSPEC section.

This keyword can only be used if OPM Flow’s thermal option has been activated by the THERMAL keyword in the RUNSPEC section. Note this is different to the commercial simulator that uses the TEMP keyword in the RUNSPEC section to activate the black-oil thermal model.

| 1 | HEATCR | HEATCR is an array of real positive numbers that define reservoir rock volumetric heat capacity of a grid block. Repeat counts may be used, for example 3000*25.0 | None |
| Btu/ft3/°R | kJ/m3/K | J/cm3/K |  |
| Notes: |  |  |  |

*Table 6.43: HEATCR Keyword Description*


Note this keyword is incompatible with SPECROCK keyword in the PROPS section.


#### Example


```
--
--       DEFINE GRID BLOCK RESERVOIR ROCK HEAT CAPACITY
--       FOR ALL CELLS (BASED ON NX x NY x NZ = 300)
--       KEYWORD IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE SPECROCK KEYWORD
--       (OPM FLOW THERMAL OPTION ONLY)
--
HEATCR
         300*32.0                                                              /
```


The above example defines the reservoir rock volumetric heat capacity of 32.0 for each cell in the 300 grid block model.

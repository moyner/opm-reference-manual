### EQUALS – Sets a Specified Array to a Constant


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The EQUALS keyword sets a specified array or part of an array to a constant. The constant can be an integer or real value depending on the array type; however, the arrays that can be operated on are dependent on which section the EQUALS keyword is being applied in.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | :------ | --- |
| 1 | ARRAY | A character string of up to eight characters in length that defines the keyword identifying the property to be modified. | None |
| 2 | CONSTANT | An integer or real value that the ARRAY will be set to in the same units as the ARRAY property. | None |
| 3 | I1 | A positive integer that defines the lower bound of the array in the I-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to I2 and NX. | 1 |
| 4 | I2 | A positive integer that defines the upper bound of the array in the I-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal to II and less than or equal to NX | NX |
| 5 | J1 | A positive integer that defines the lower bound of the array in the J-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to J2 and NY. | 1 |
| 6 | J2 | A positive integer that defines the upper bound of the array in the J-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal to JI and less than or equal to NY. | NY |
| 7 | K1 | A positive integer that defines the lower bound of the array in the K-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to K2 and NZ. | 1 |
| 8 | K2 | A positive integer that defines the upper bound of the array in the K-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal to KI and less than or equal to NZ. | NZ |

Examples of the arrays most commonly operated on in each section are given in Table 6.36. Cells colored red indicate arrays that are not supported by OPM Flow operations.

*Table 6.36: EQUALS Keyword Applicable Arrays by Section*


::: {.callout-note}
Unlike the commercial simulator, using the EQUALS keyword to setup the structure of the grid using the DX, DY, DZ and TOPS keywords should be avoided as it may cause OPM Flow to prematurely fail during the initialization. See the second example on the correct way to setup this type of grid.

#### Examples

The first example resets the PERMX, PERMY and PERMZ, arrays to 0.10, 0.10, and 0.01 for all cells in layer five, respectively.


```
--
--  ARRAY     CONSTANT      ---------- BOX ---------
-                           I1  I2   J1  J2   K1  K2
EQUALS
    PERMX     0.1000        1*  1*   1*  1*   5   5  / PERMX TO 0.10 IN LAYER 5
    PERMY     0.1000        1*  1*   1*  1*   5   5  / PERMY TO 0.10 IN LAYER 5
    PERMZ     0.0100        1*  1*   1*  1*   5   5  / PERMZ TO 0.01 IN LAYER 5
/
```


The second example illustrates how to correctly setup a Cartesian Regular Grid in OPM Flow, given the  DIMENS keyword in the RUNSPEC section is set to:


```
--
--       MAX     MAX     MAX
--       NDIVIX  NDIVIY  NDIVIZ
DIMENS
         10       10      3                                                    /
```


and the following keywords in the GRID section:


```
--
--       ACTIVATE IRREGULAR CORNER-POINT GRID TRANSMISSIBILITIES
--
OLDTRAN
--
--       DEFINE GRID BLOCK X DIRECTION CELL SIZE (BASED ON NX = 5)

--
--       DEFINE GRID BLOCK Y DIRECTION CELL SIZE (BASED ON NY = 5)
--
DY
         300*1000                                                              /

--
--       DEFINE GRID BLOCK TOPS FOR THE TOP LAYER
--
TOPS
         100*8325                                                              /
--
--       ARRAY    CONSTANT        ---------- BOX ---------

         NTG         1.000                                 /

         PERMX     200.000        1*  1*   1*  1*    3   3 / Layer #03 Properties
         PERMY     200.000                                 /
         PERMZ     200.000                                 /
         PORO        0.300                                 /
         NTG         1.000                                 /
/
```


Notice that the DX, DY, DZ and TOPS keywords are defined separately, that is they are not included in the EQUALS keyword.

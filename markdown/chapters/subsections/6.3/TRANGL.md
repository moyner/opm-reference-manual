#### Description

[TRANGL](#__RefHeading___Toc1306682_4250154414) enables Non-Neighbor Connections (“NNC”) between the global cells and the Local Grid Refinement (“LGR”) cells to be manually specified, as oppose to the simulator calculating the transmissibilities.  The [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section should be utilized to define the presence of LGRs in the model and to define various [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) dimension parameters.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |

| Field | Metric | Laboratory |  |
| 1 | I1 | A positive integer that defines the [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) grid block in the I-direction in a non-neighbor connection, must be greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to NX on the [CARFIN](#__RefHeading___Toc150726_63720426) keyword in the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) section. | None |
| 2 | J1 | A positive integer that defines the [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) grid block in the J-direction in a non-neighbor connection, must be greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to NY on the [CARFIN](#__RefHeading___Toc150726_63720426) keyword in the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) section. | None |
| 3 | K1 | A positive integer that defines the [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) grid block in the K-direction in a non-neighbor connection, must be greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to NZ on the [CARFIN](#__RefHeading___Toc150726_63720426) keyword in the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) section. | None |
| 4 | I2 | A positive integer that defines the GLOBAL grid block in the I-direction in a non-neighbor connection, must be greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to NX on the [DIMENS](#__RefHeading___Toc20387_2267116897) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section. | None |
| 5 | J2 | A positive integer that defines the GLOBAL grid block in the J-direction in a non-neighbor connection, must be greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to NY on the [DIMENS](#__RefHeading___Toc20387_2267116897) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section. | None |
| 6 | K2 | A positive integer that defines the GLOBAL grid block in the K-direction in a non-neighbor connection, must be greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to NZ on the [DIMENS](#__RefHeading___Toc20387_2267116897) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section. | None |
| 7 | TRANSNNC | TRANSNNC is a positive real number greater than or equal to zero that defines the transmissibility between the GLOBAL grid block (I1, J1, K1) and the [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) grid block (I2, J2, K2). The default value of zero sets the transmissibility between the two cells to zero. | 0.0 |

#### Example


```
--
--       MANUALLY DEFINE LGR-GLOBAL GRID NON-NEIGHBOR CONNECTIONS
--
--       ----LGR-----   ---GLOBAL----   -- TRANSNCC --
--       I1   J1   K1    I2   J2   K2
TRANGL
         1    1    1     1    1    2        0.2500     /
         1    1    2     1    1    3        0.2500     /
         1    1    3     1    1    4        0.2500     /
/

```

The above example defines the transmissibility between [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) cell (1, 1, 1) and global cell (1, 1, 2), [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) cell  (1, 1, 2) and global cell (1, 1, 3) and finally between [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) cell (1, 1, 3) and global cell (1, 1, 4) to be 0.2500.

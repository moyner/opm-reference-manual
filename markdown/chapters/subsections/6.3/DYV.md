#### Description

DYV defines the size of grid blocks in the Y direction via a vector as opposed to defining the Y direction cell size for each cell for a Cartesian Regular Grid.

| 1 | DYV | DYV is a vector of real numbers describing the cell size for the grid blocks in the Y direction. Repeat counts may be used, for example 10*100.0. | None |

*Table 6.29: DYV Keyword Description*


See also the DXV, DZV and TOPS keywords to fully define a Cartesian Regular Grid.


#### Example


```
--
--        DEFINE GRID BLOCK Y DIRECTION CELL SIZE (BASED ON NY = 5)
--
DYV
          5*100                                                                 /
```


The above example defines the size of the cells in the Y direction based on NY equals 5 on the DIMENS keyword in the RUNSPEC section.

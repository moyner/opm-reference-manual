#### Example


```
--
--        DEFINE GRID BLOCK Z DIRECTION CELL SIZE (BASED ON NX x NY x NZ = 300)
--
DZ
          100*20.0   100*30.0   100*50.0                                        /
```


The above example defines the size of the cells in the Z direction based on 300 cells in the model as defined by the DIMENS keyword in the RUNSPEC section.

### PINCHNUM – Define Pinch-Out Regions for the PINCHREG Keyword


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The PINCHNUM keyword defines the pinch-out region numbers for each grid block, as such there must be one entry for each cell in the model. The array is used with the PINCHREG keyword to set the pinch-out options and threshold thickness for each region.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

| 1 | PINCHNUM | PINCHNUM defines an array of positive integers assigning a grid cell to a particular PINCHNUM region. The maximum number of PINCHNUM regions is set by the NRPINC variable on the GRIDOPTS keyword in the RUNSPEC section. | 1 |

#### Example

The example below sets defines three PINCHNUM regions for various layers in a model based on the model’s layering.


```
--
--       ARRAY       CONSTANT     ---------- BOX ---------
--                                I1  I2   J1  J2   K1  K2
EQUALS
         MULTNUM     1            1*  1*   1*  1*   1*  1* / SET REGION 1
         MULTNUM     2            1   2    1   2    10  50 / SET REGION 2
         MULTNUM     3            1   2    1   2    51 100 / SET REGION 3
/

```

One can then set the pinch-out criteria for each region.


```
--
--       SET PINCH-OUT CRITERA VIA THE PINCHNUM REGION
--
PINCHREG
--       THRESHOLD   GAP      EMPTY   TRANS
--       THICKNESS   NO GAP   GAP     CALC
         0.1         1*       1*      1*                  / PINCHNUM 01
         1.0         1*       10      1*                  / PINCHNUM 02
         1.0         NOGAP    20      1*                  / PINCHNUM 03
```


The above example sets the default pinch-out criteria for grid blocks defined as region one via the PINCHNUM array and different criteria for regions two and three.

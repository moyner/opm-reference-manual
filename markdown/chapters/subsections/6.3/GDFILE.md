#### Description

The [GDFILE](#__RefHeading___Toc139346_951517595) keyword loads a GRID file that contains the structural data for the grid as a set of topological cuboidal cells, and EGRID files that contain structural and property data. Note OPM Flow only supports reading in EGRID files at this time.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | GRIDFILE | A character string enclosed in quotes that defines the GRID or EGRID file to be read in and be processed by OPM Flow. Again, OPM Flow only supports reading in EGRID files. | None |
| 2 | FMTOPT | A defined character string that defines the format of the GRID or EGRID file to be read and should be set to one of the following: If the variable FMTOPT is omitted then the default is for binary file input for the commercial simulator; whereas, OPM Flow derives FMTOPT from the file extension (*.EGRID or *.FEGRID), making FMTOPT superfluous. | U |

See also the [GRIDFILE](#__RefHeading___Toc45785_719036256) keyword in the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) section for exporting the GRID and EGRID files from the current simulation run.


#### Examples

The first example shown below loads the NOR-OPM-A00-GRID.EGRID file in binary format from the same directory as the data file.


```
--
--       LOAD A GRID FILE
--
GDFILE
         'NOR-OPM-A00-GRID.EGRID'      /

```

The next example loads the same EGRID file one directory above from where the data file is located.


```

--
--       LOAD a GRID FILE
--
GDFILE
         '../NOR-OPM-A00-GRID.EGRID'  /


```

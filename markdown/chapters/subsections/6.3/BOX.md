### BOX – Define a Range of Grid Blocks to Enter Property Data


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

BOX defines a range of grid blocks for which subsequent data is assigned for all the cells in the defined BOX. Values are set for cells within the defined box grid using natural reading order, initially along the I-direction then J-direction and finally the K-direction. If fewer values are assigned than exist within the defined block space, then subsequent values are set starting from the next block that was not previously assigned for that property. This is the same behavior as applies to setting grid properties for an unboxed grid.

Note that the BOX grid is reset by the keyword ENDBOX by resetting the current defined BOX to be the  whole grid. The keyword can be used for any array and for all grid types.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | I1 | A positive integer that defines the lower bound of the array in the I-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal 1 and less than or equal to I2 and NX. | 1 |
| 2 | I2 | A positive integer that defines the upper bound of the array in the I-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal to II and less than or equal to NX | NX |
| 3 | J1 | A positive integer that defines the lower bound of the array in the J-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal 1 and less than or equal to J2 and NY. | 1 |
| 4 | J2 | A positive integer that defines the upper bound of the array in the J-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal to JI and less than or equal to NY. | NY |
| 5 | K1 | A positive integer that defines the lower bound of the array in the K-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to K2 and NZ. | 1 |
| 6 | K2 | A positive integer that defines the upper bound of the array in the K-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal to KI and less than or equal to NZ. | NZ |

*Table 6.11: BOX Keyword Description*


See also the ADD, COPY, ENDBOX, EQUALS,  and MULTIPLY keywords can also be used to enter data in a subset of the model.


#### Examples


```
--
--        DEFINE A BOX GRID FOR THE BOTTOM LAYER OF A 100 X 100 X 20 MODEL
--
--        ---------- BOX ---------
--        I1  I2   J1  J2   K1  K2
BOX
          1*  1*   1*  1*   20  20 / SELECT THE BOTTOM LAYER
--
--        DEFINE THE POROSITY AND OTHER PROPERTIES ON THE BOX GRID
--
PORO
          10000*0.300                                                                     /
PERMX
          5000*100.0   5000*75.0                                                                     /
NTG
          10000*0.500                                                                     /
--
--        RESET THE INPUT BOX TO BE THE FULL MODEL
--
ENDBOX

```

The above example set the BOX grid to be the last layer in the model which means that 100 x 100, that is 10,000 values need to entered for each property.

Alternatively, one could use the EQUALS keyword to accomplish the same thing.


```
-- -- ARRAY    CONSTANT --  ---------- BOX ---------
--                          I1  I2   J1  J2   K1  K2
EQUALS
   'PORO’      0.3000       1*  1*   1*  1*   20  20 / PORO  TO 0.30 IN LAYER 20
   'PERMX'     100.00       1*  1*   1   50   20  20 / PERMX TO 100. IN LAYER 20
   'PERMX'      75.00       1*  1*   51  100  20  20 / PERMX TO 75.0 IN LAYER 20
   'NTG’       0.5000       1*  1*   1*  1*   20  20 / NTG   TO 0.50 IN LAYER 20
/
```


| Note It is good practice to always use the ENDBOX keyword to reset the input back to the full grid when all the modifications for a sub-grid have been completed. |

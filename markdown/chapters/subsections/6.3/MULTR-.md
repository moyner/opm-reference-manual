### MULTR- – Multiply Cell Transmissibility in the -R Direction


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

MULTR- multiples the transmissibility between two cell faces in the -R direction for all the cells in the model via an array, that is the keyword sets the transmissibility multiplier of block (I, J, K) between the cells (I-1, J, K) and (I, J, K).   An alternative to defining the complete array is to use the BOX keyword to define an area of the grid and then use the MULTR- keyword to set the multipliers just for the area defined by the BOX keyword (see the example).

The keyword should only be used with radial and spider grids, as declared by the RADIAL or SPIDER keywords in the RUNSPEC section.

| 1 | MULTR- | MULTR- is an array of real positive numbers assigning the transmissibility multipliers in the -R direction to each cell face in the model. Repeat counts may be used, for example 20*100.0. | 1.0 |

*Table 6.75: MULTR- Keyword Description*


Note that OPM Flow does not require the GRIDOPTS(TRANMULT) parameter in the RUNSPEC section to be set to YES, in order to use this and other negative directional dependent multiplier keywords in the input deck. Whereas, the commercial simulator will terminate with an error if the keyword is present, and the GRIDOPTS(TRANMULT) parameter has not been set to YES.

See also the MULTR, MULTTHT, MULTTHT-, MULTZ and MULTZ- keywords for scaling transmissible between cells in the R direction.


#### Example


```
--
--       DEFINE INPUT BOX FOR EDITING INPUT ARRAYS
--
--       ---------- BOX ---------
--       I1  I2   J1  J2   K1  K2
BOX
         10  10   1   6    1   1                           / DEFINE BOX AREA
--
--       SET MULTR- TRANSMISSIBILITY MULTIPLIERS
--
MULTR-
         6*0.500                                           /
--
--       DEFINE END OF INPUT BOX EDITING OF INPUT ARRAYS
--
ENDBOX
```


The above example defines a 0.5 scaling multiplier for the six cells defined by the preceding BOX statement. The ENDBOX keyword resets the input box to the full grid.

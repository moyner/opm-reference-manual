#### Description

HZFIN defines the split ratio of grid blocks for the DZV keyword in the z-direction via a vector within a Local Grid Refinement (“LGR”) as opposed to defining the size for each cell for a Cartesian LGR Grid. The LGR keyword in the RUNSPEC section should be activated to indicate an LGR is being used, and the keyword HYFIN should be placed in between the CARFIN and ENDFIN keywords in the GRID section. The DZV keyword in the GRID section defines the grid size in terms of the length, that is feet for field units, this keyword defines the length as the ratio of the coarse cells.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

| 1 | HYZIN | HZFIN is a vector of real numbers describing the ratio of cell size for the grid blocks in the z-direction in a Cartesian LGR grid. Repeat counts may be used, for example 2*2.0. | None |

The above example defines the size of the cells in the z-direction based on NZ equals 100 on the CARFIN keyword in the GRID section.

#### Description

This keyword controls the output of a standard [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) or extended [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) file, as well as the extensible EGRID file for post-processing applications.  The extended and extensible [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) formats are comparable; however, the extensible [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) format is more compact and is the only format supported by OPM Flow.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | NGRID | A positive integer that controls the output of the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) geometry file: Only the default value of zero is supported. | 0 |
| 2 | NEGRID | A positive integer that controls the output of the EGRID geometry file: Only the default value of one is supported. | 1 |

#### Example


```
--
--       GRID FILE OUTPUT OPTIONS
--       GRID    EGRID
--       OPTN    OPTN
GRIDFILE
         0       1                                                             /
```


The above example defines that no [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) file will be written out and that the extensible [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) (that is the EGRID geometry format) file will be produced.  This is the only configuration that OPM Flow supports

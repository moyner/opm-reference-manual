#### Description

[MULTFLT](#__RefHeading___Toc90875_3218818441) enables the transmissibilities across defined faults, as declared by the [FAULTS](#__RefHeading___Toc45779_719036256) keyword, to be modified. They keyword allows for the re-scaling of the existing fault transmissibilities calculated by OPM Flow, for example setting a fault to be completely sealing by setting the multiplier to zero.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | FLTNAME | FLTNAME is a character string enclosed in quotes with a maximum length of eight characters, that defines the name of the fault that FLTMULT will be applied to. FLTNAME must have previously been defined using the [FAULTS](#__RefHeading___Toc45779_719036256) keyword in [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) section | None |
| 2 | FLT-TRS | A positive real number that sets the transmissible multiplier to be applied to the FLTNAME transmissibilities positive real number that sets the transmissible multiplier to be applied to the FLTNAME transmissibilities. | 1.0 |
| 3 | FLT-DIF | A positive real number that sets the diffusivity multiplier to be applied to the FLTNAME diffusivities. This option should only be used if the Diffusion option has been made activate by the [DIFFUSE](#__RefHeading___Toc349951_1539708736) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section. OPM Flow does not support this Diffusion option. | 1.0 |

#### Example


```
--
--       MODIFY THE TRANSMISSIBILITES ACROSS DEFINED FAULTS
--
--       FAULT            TRANS           DIFUSS
--       NAME             MULTIPLIER      MULTIPLIER
MULTFLT
         'FAULT01'        0.0                                 / FAULT MULTIPLIERS
         'FAULT02'        0.0                                 / FAULT MULTIPLIERS
         'FAULT03'        0.0                                 / FAULT MULTIPLIERS
/

```

The above example sets the fault transmissibility multiplier for defined faults named FAULT01, FAULT02, and FAULT03 to zero making the faults sealing in the model.

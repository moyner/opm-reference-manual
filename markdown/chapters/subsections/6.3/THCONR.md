### THCONR – Define Rock and Fluid Thermal Conductivity for All Cells


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The THCONR keyword defines the reservoir rock plus fluid thermal conductivity for all cells for when the thermal calculation is activated by the THERMAL keywords in the RUNSPEC section.

This keyword can only be used if the thermal option has been activated by the THERMAL keyword in the RUNSPEC section. Note this is different to the commercial simulator that uses the TEMP keyword in the RUNSPEC section to activate the black-oil thermal model.

| 1 | THCONR | THCONR is an array of real positive numbers that define the combined rock and fluid conductivity of a grid block. Repeat counts may be used, for example 3000*25.0 | None |
| Btu/ft/day/°R | kJ/m/day/K | J/cm/hr/K |  |
| Notes: |  |  |  |

*Table 6.124: THCONR Keyword Description*


Note that there two ways to define the rock and in situ fluids thermal conductivity:

    - Either by using the THCONR keyword to define the combined rock and fluid conductivity, and optionally the THCONSF keyword in the GRID section, or
    - by specifying the rock and fluid conductivities individually using the THCROCK, THCOIL, THCGAS, and THCWATER keywords in the GRID section.

Hence,  the THCROCK and THCONR keywords are mutually exclusive.


#### Example


```
--
--       DEFINE GRID BLOCK ROCK-FLUID THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY
–        FOR ALL CELLS (BASED ON NX x NY x NZ = 300)
--
THCONR
         300*25.0                                                              /
```


The above example defines the combined rock and fluid thermal conductivity of 25.0 for each cell in the 300 grid block model, as defined by the DIMENS keyword in the RUNSPEC section.

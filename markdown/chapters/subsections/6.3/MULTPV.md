### MULTPV – Multiply Cell Pore Volumes by a Constant


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |

#### Description

MULTPV multiples the pore volumes of a cell by a real positive constant for all the cells in the model via an array. An alternative to defining the complete array is to use the BOX keyword to define an area of the grid and then use the MULTPV keyword to set the multipliers just for the area defined by the BOX keyword (see the example).

The keyword can be used for all grid types, except for the Radial Grid geometry.

| 1 | MULTPV | MULTPV is an array of real positive numbers assigning the pore volume multipliers for each cell in the model. Repeat counts may be used, for example 20*100.0. | 1.0 |

See also the MULTREGP keyword for scaling the cell pore volumes by region numbers.


#### Example


```
--
--       DEFINE INPUT BOX FOR EDITING INPUT ARRAYS
--
--       ---------- BOX ---------
--       I1  I2   J1  J2   K1  K2
BOX
         10  10   1   6    1   3                           / DEFINE BOX AREA
--
--       SET PORE VOLUME MULTIPLIERS
--
MULTPV
         18*0.0500                                         /
--
--       DEFINE END OF INPUT BOX EDITING OF INPUT ARRAYS
--
ENDBOX

```

The above example defines a 0.05 scaling multiplier for the 18 cells defined by the preceding BOX statement. The ENDBOX keyword resets the input box to the full grid.

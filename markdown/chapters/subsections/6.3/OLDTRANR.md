### OLDTRANR – Activate Radial Regular Grid Transmissibilities


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |

#### Description

This keyword switches on Radial Regular Grids geometry transmissibility calculation (or block centered transmissibility calculations), which is the default option for this type of grid. Grids defined by the DR, DTHETA, and DZ series of keywords will always invoke this option by default.

For Irregular Corner-Point Grids defined by the COORD and ZCORN keywords Irregular Corner-Point Grid geometry transmissibility calculations should be activated via the NEWTRAN keyword. Again this is automatically invoked if this type of grid is being employed.

There is no data required for this keyword and there is no terminating “/” for this keyword.


#### Example


```
--
--       ACTIVATE RADIAL REGULAR GRID TRANSMISSIBILITIES
--
OLDTRANR
```


The above example manually activates Radial Regular Grid transmissibility calculations.

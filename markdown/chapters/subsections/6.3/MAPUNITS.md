#### Description

The [MAPUNITS](#__RefHeading___Toc39962_2479612490) keyword defines the units of the coordinates stated on the [MAPAXES](#__RefHeading___Toc39960_2479612490) keyword. It is usually output by pre-processing software when exporting the grid geometry. The data is not used by OPM Flow intrinsically, but is merely written to the output EGRID file, as specified by the [GRIDFILE](#__RefHeading___Toc45785_719036256) keyword, for the use of post-processing software like OPM ResInsight.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but has no effect on the results so it will be ignored.

| 1 | [MAPUNITS](#__RefHeading___Toc39962_2479612490) | A character string that defines the units of the coordinates stated on the [MAPAXES](#__RefHeading___Toc39960_2479612490) keyword, and should be set to: | METRES |
| Notes: |  |  |  |

#### Example


```
--
--       SET THE MAP UNITS FOR THE MAPAXES KEYWORD
MAPUNITS
         METRES                                                                /
```


The above example specifies the units on the [MAPAXES](#__RefHeading___Toc39960_2479612490) to be the default METRES.

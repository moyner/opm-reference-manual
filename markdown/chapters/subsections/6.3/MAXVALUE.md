| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The MAXVALUE keyword sets a maximum value for the specified array or part of an array. The constant can be an integer or real value depending on the array type; however, the arrays that can be operated on are dependent on which section the MAXVALUE keyword is being applied in.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | :------ | --- |
| 1 | ARRAY | A character string of up to eight characters in length that defines the keyword identifying the array to be modified. | None |
| 2 | CONSTANT | CONSTANT is a positive integer or positive real value that an ARRAY element will be reset to if an element in the defined input BOX, as defined by items (3) to (8), is greater than CONSTANT. CONSTANT has in the same units as the ARRAY property. | None |
| 3 | I1 | The lower bound of the array in the I-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to I2 and NX. | 1 |
| 4 | I2 | The upper bound of the array in the I-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal to I1 and less than or equal to NX | NX |
| 5 | J1 | The lower bound of the array in the J-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to J2 and NY. | 1 |
| 6 | J2 | The upper bound of the array in the J-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal to J1 and less than or equal to NY. | NY |
| 7 | K1 | The lower bound of the array in the K-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to K2 and NZ. | 1 |
| 8 | K2 | The upper bound of the array in the K-direction to be modified must be greater than or equal to K1 and less than or equal to NZ. | NZ |

Examples of the arrays most commonly operated on in each section are given in Table 6.61. Cells colored red indicate arrays that are not supported by OPM Flow operations.

*Table 6.61: MAXVALUE Keyword Applicable Arrays by Section*


#### Example


```
--
--       ARRAY     CONSTANT       ---------- BOX ---------
--                                I1  I2   J1  J2   K1  K2
MAXVALUE
         PERMX     1.0E2          1*  1*   1*  1*   1*  1* / MAX VALUE FOR PERMX
         PERMY     1.0E2          1*  1*   1*  1*   1*  1* / MAX VALUE FOR PERMY
         PERMZ     1.0E1          1*  1*   1*  1*   1*  1* / MAX VALUE FOR PERMZ
/
```


The above example resets the maximum values for the PERMX, PERMY and PERMZ, arrays to 100.0, 100.0 and 10.0, respectively,  for all cells.

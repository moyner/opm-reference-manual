#### Description

The [GRIDUNIT](#__RefHeading___Toc41568_2479612490) keyword defines the units of the grid data. It is usually output by pre-processing software when exporting the grid geometry. The data is not used by OPM Flow intrinsically, but is merely written to the output EGRID file, as specified by the [GRIDFILE](#__RefHeading___Toc45785_719036256) keyword, for the use of post-processing software like OPM ResInsight.

| 1 | [GRIDUNIT](#__RefHeading___Toc41568_2479612490) | A character string that defines the units of the coordinates stated on the [MAPAXES](#__RefHeading___Toc39960_2479612490) keyword, and should be set to: | METRES |
| 2 | MAPOPT | A character string that defines if the grid data are measured relative to the map, or relative to the origin as stated on the [MAPAXES](#__RefHeading___Toc39960_2479612490) keyword. MAPOPT should either be left blank (the default) indicating the origin is relative to the origin on the [MAPAXES](#__RefHeading___Toc39960_2479612490) keyword, or set equal to MAP measured relative to the map. | 1* |

#### Example


```
--
--       SET THE GRID UNITS FOR THE GRID
--
GRIDUNIT
         METRES                                                                /
```


The above example defines that the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) units to be metric.

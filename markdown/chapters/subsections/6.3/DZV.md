| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |

#### Description

DZV defines the size of grid blocks in the Z direction via a vector as opposed to defining the thickness property for each cell. The keyword is used for both Cartesian Regular Grids and Radial Grids.

| 1 | DZV | DZV is a vector of real numbers describing the cell size for the grid blocks in the Z direction. Repeat counts may be used, for example 10*20.0. | None |

*Table 6.32: DZV Keyword Description*


See also the DXV, DYV and TOPS keywords for a Cartesian Regular Grid and DRV, DTHETAV and TOPS keywords to fully define a Radial Grid model.


#### Example


```
--
--       DEFINE GRID BLOCK SIZES IN THE Z DIRECTION (BASED ON NZ = 20)
--
DZV
         3.0   5.0   3.0   2.0   5.0  15*3.0                                    /
```


The above example defines the size of the cells in the Z direction based on NZ equals 20 on the DIMENS keyword in the RUNSPEC section.

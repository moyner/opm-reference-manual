#### Description

The [PINCHXY](#__RefHeading___Toc775709_2928331029) keyword defines the x-direction and y-direction threshold thickness used to control the generation of Non-Neighbor Connections (“NNCs”) in the x- and y- directions for missing cells in the areal plane.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

| Field | Metric | Laboratory |  |
| 1 | PINCHTHX | A real number defining the pinch-out threshold width for any cell in the x-direction.  NNCs are generated across inactive cells having a width less than PINCHTHX in the x-direction. | Defined |
| ft. 0.001 | m 0.001 | cm 0.001 |  |
| 2 | PINCHTHY | A real number defining the pinch-out threshold width for any cell in the y-direction.  NNCs are generated across inactive cells having a width less than PINCHTHY in the y-direction. | Defined |
| ft. 0.001 | m 0.001 | cm 0.001 |  |

#### Example

The example below will create NNCs between the cells in the areal plane having cell widths less than 0.01 in either feet or metres in both the x- and y-directions.

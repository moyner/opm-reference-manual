#### Description

The USENOFLUX keyword activates the Flux Boundary model without a FLUX file.  The [USEFLUX](#__RefHeading___Toc1709193_4250154414) keyword should still be in the input deck, but in this case the FLUX filename is ignored. The option is useful when the no-flow boundary condition is a reasonable assumption and avoids the pre-cursor run used to generate the FLUX file via the [DUMPFLUX](#__RefHeading___Toc65329_3218818441) keyword in the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) section. Only grid blocks that have been declared by the [FLUXREG](#__RefHeading___Toc290821_803326780) keyword in the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) section to be in an active flux region, are active for the run.

There is no data required for this keyword and there is no terminating “/” for this keyword.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

#### Example


```
--
--       ACTIVATE FLUX BOUNDARY MODEL WITHOUT A FLUX FILE
--
USEFLUX
/

USENOFLO
```


The above example activates the Flux Boundary model without a FLUX file.

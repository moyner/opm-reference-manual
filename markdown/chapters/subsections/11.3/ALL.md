#### Description

This keyword activates the writing out of a standard set of summary production and injection data vectors for the field, group and well objects to the SUMMARY (*.SMSPEC and *.UNSMRY) and RSM (*.RSM) files. Table 11.26 lists the production, injection, pressure and volume summary variables written out by the ALL keyword, and Table 11.27 list the aquifer variables.

Note the SEPARATE keyword is not required for OPM Flow as this is the default behavior; however, it is probably good practice to include it if the same input decks are being run with commercial simulator.

### RPTONLY – Activate the Report Time Steps Only Option for the SUMMARY File


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

This keyword activates the writing out of the SUMMARY file and the RSM file data, if the RSM file option has been requested by the RUNSUM keyword in the SUMMARY section, at report time steps only.  The default is for the data to be written out for all time steps to the SUMMARY files.  This keyword reduces the file size at the expense of lower resolution in the time domain.

There is no data required for this keyword and there is no terminating “/” for this keyword.

The option can be deactivated by the RPTONLYO keyword in the SUMMARY section.


#### Example


```
-- ==============================================================================
--
-- SUMMARY SECTION
--
-- ==============================================================================

--       EXPORT STANDARD SUMMARY VARIABLE VECTORS TO FILE
--

RUNSUM
--
--       ACTIVATE SUMMARY DATA RSM FILE OUTPUT OPTION
--

--
--       ACTIVATE REPORT TIME STEPS ONLY SUMMARY FILE OPTION
--
RPTONLY
```


The above example activates the writing out of the SUMMARY file at report time steps only.

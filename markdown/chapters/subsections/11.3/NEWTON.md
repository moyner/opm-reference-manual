#### Description

This keyword activates the writing out of the Newton iteration vector (the number of non-linear iterations per time step) to the [SUMMARY](#kw-SUMMARY) file, and the RSM file if the RSM file option has been requested by the [RUNSUM](#kw-RUNSUM) keyword in the [SUMMARY](#kw-SUMMARY) section,

There is no data required for this keyword and there is no terminating “/” for this keyword.

Although the keyword is recognized by OPM Flow only zeros are written to the [SUMMARY](#kw-SUMMARY) file.


#### Example


```
-- ==============================================================================
--
-- SUMMARY SECTION
--
-- ==============================================================================
SUMMARY
--
--       ACTIVATE COLUMNAR SUMMARY DATA REPORTING OPTION
--
RUNSUM
--
--       ACTIVATE SUMMARY DATA RSM FILE OUTPUT OPTION
--
SEPARATE       --
--       ACTIVATE NEWTON ITERATION SUMMARY OUTPUT

```


The above example actives the writing out of the Newton iteration vector to the [SUMMARY](#kw-SUMMARY) file.

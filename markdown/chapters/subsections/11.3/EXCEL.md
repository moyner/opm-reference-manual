#### Description

This keyword activates the writing out of the RSM file data in a format that can easily be loaded into Microsoft's EXCEL spreadsheet program or LibreOffice’s CALC spreadsheet program. The RSM file output is activated by the [RUNSUM](#kw-RUNSUM) keyword in the [SUMMARY](#kw-SUMMARY) section.

There is no data required for this keyword and there is no terminating “/” for this keyword.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but has no effect on the results so it will be ignored.

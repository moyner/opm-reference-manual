#### Description

This keyword is similar to the [ALL](#__RefHeading___Toc4420_421927891) keyword in the [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) section, in that it results in a group of summary variables to be written out to the [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) file. In this case the keyword activates the writing out of a set of data vectors that give the production and injections status of all the wells in the named groups, as well as the number of wells in the drilling queue and the number of workover events occurring within a time step for the requested groups. Both instantaneous and cumulative well counts and events for the groups are written out as tabulated in Table 11.29.

Note that [GMWSET](#__RefHeading___Toc110660_3115110868) should be followed by a list of group names enclosed in quotes and therefore a terminating  “/” is required to end the list of groups.  A blank list requests output for all groups.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but has no effect on the results so it will be ignored.

See also the [FMWSET](#__RefHeading___Toc110662_3115110868) keyword in the [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) schedule that has similar functionality but at the field level.


#### Examples

The first example below exports all the group standard well status variables to the [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) file.


```

The second example exports all the group standard well status variables for just the PLAT1 and PLT2 groups only to the [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) file.

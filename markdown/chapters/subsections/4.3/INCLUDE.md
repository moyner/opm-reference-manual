### INCLUDE – Load Another Data File at the Current Position

#### Description

The [INCLUDE](#__RefHeading___Toc55749_2479612490) keyword informs OPM Flow to continue reading input data from the specified [INCLUDE](#__RefHeading___Toc55749_2479612490) file. When the end of the [INCLUDE](#__RefHeading___Toc55749_2479612490) file is reached, or the [ENDINC](#__RefHeading___Toc51671_2479612490) keyword is encountered in the included file, input data is read from the next keyword in the current file. Although [INCLUDE](#__RefHeading___Toc55749_2479612490) files can be nested, that is [INCLUDE](#__RefHeading___Toc55749_2479612490) files within [INCLUDE](#__RefHeading___Toc55749_2479612490) files etc., in practice this should be avoided due to the complexity of tracking the files.

#### Examples

The first example shown below loads the grid file from the same directory as the data file.


```
--
--       LOAD INCLUDE FILE
--
INCLUDE
         'NOR-OPM-A00-GRID.inc'  /

```

The next example loads the same file one directory above from where the data file is located.


```
--
--       LOAD INCLUDE FILE
--
INCLUDE
         '../NOR-OPM-A00-FAULTS.inc'  /
```


The final example loads the same file from a separate include directory found in the parent directory relative to where the data file is located.


```
--
--       LOAD INCLUDE FILE
--
INCLUDE
         '../INCLUDE/NOR-OPM-A00-FAULTS.inc'  /
```

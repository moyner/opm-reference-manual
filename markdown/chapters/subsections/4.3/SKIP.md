### SKIP – Activate Skipping of All Keywords and Input Data


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The SKIP keyword activates skipping of all keywords and input data until the ENDSKIP keyword is encountered. All keywords between the SKIP and ENDSKIP keywords are ignored. Each SKIP keyword should be paired with an ENDSKIP keyword. See also the SKIP100 and SKIP300 keywords.

There is no data required for this keyword.

The nesting of pairs of the SKIP, SKIP100, or SKIP300 keywords and the ENDSKIP keyword is not supported by OPM Flow.


#### Example


```
--
--       SWITCH ON SKIPPING OF ALL KEYWORDS AND DATA
--
SKIP
--
--       INCLUDE SIMULATION GRID WITH SLOPING FAULTS
--
INCLUDE
         './INCLUDE/GRID/IRAP_1005.GRDECL' /
--
--       SWITCH ON READING OF ALL KEYWORDS AND DATA
--
ENDSKIP
```


The example skips reading of the grid geometry data input using the INCLUDE keyword, and then reverts back to reading the remainder of the input file.

*Table 4.3: FORMFEED Keyword Description*


This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.


#### Example


```
--
--       ACTIVATE EXTRAPOLATION MESSAGES
--
FORMFEED
         3                                                                      /

The above example sets the carriage return character to no form-feed character.

#### Description

SOWCR defines the critical oil saturation for all the cells in the model via an array when the end-point scaling option has been invoked via the ENDSCALE keyword in the RUNSPEC section. The critical oil saturation with respect to water is defined as the maximum oil saturation for which the oil relative permeability is zero in a two-phase oil-water relative permeability table.

The keyword can be used with all grid types.

| 1 | SOWCR | SOWCR is an array of real numbers assigning the critical oil saturation with respect to water values to each cell in the model. The number of entries should correspond to the NX x NY x NZ parameters on the DIMENS keyword. Repeat counts may be used, for example 30*0.30 | Taken from cell allocated relative permeability table. |

*Table 8.169: SOWCR Keyword Description*


End-point scaling allows the entered relative permeability functions to be re-scaled based on the saturation end-points allocated to each cell by the SWL, SWCR, SWU, SGL, SGCR, SGU, SOWCR, and SOGCR  saturation grid arrays for the saturation end-points, and the KRG, KRGR, KRO, KRORG, KRORW, KRW and KRWR relative permeability grid cell arrays for the relative permeability end-point data. In addition end-point scaling may be directional dependent in which case the directional dependent versions of the aforementioned arrays should be used, that is SOWCRX, SOWCRY and SOWCRZ instead of SOWCR. There is also the facility to make the directional end-point scaling reversible or non-reversible and if the non-reversible option is selected the  non-reversible versions of the aforementioned arrays should be used, that is SOWCRX, SOWCRX-, SOWCRY, SOWCRY-,  SOWCRZ and SOWCRZ-,  instead of the SOWCR keyword.


#### Example


```
--
--       DEFINE GRID BLOCK END-POINT SOWCR DATA FOR ALL CELLS
–        (FOR NX x NY x NZ = 300)
--
SOWCR
         300*0.200                                                              /
```

The above example defines a constant critical oil saturation of 0.20 to all 300 cells in the model as defined by the DIMENS keyword in the RUNSPEC section.

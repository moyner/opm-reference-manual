#### Description

[PCG](#__RefHeading___Toc77040_621662414) defines the maximum drainage gas-oil capillary pressure values for all the cells in the model via an array.  The [ENDSCALE](#__RefHeading___Toc68146_2267116897) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section should be activated to enable end-point scaling and the use of this keyword. The keyword can be used with all grid types.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped. See also the [IPCG](#__RefHeading___Toc77038_621662414) keyword for the equivalent imbibition functionality.

| 1 | [PCG](#__RefHeading___Toc77040_621662414) | [PCG](#__RefHeading___Toc77040_621662414) is an array of positive real numbers assigning the maximum drainage  gas-oil capillary pressure values for each cell in the model. Repeat counts may be used, for example 30*100.0. | None |

*Table 8.95: PCG Keyword Description*

The capillary pressure for a grid block is scaled by:


|  | (8.69) |
| --- | --- |

Where:

	=	the resulting drainage gas-oil capillary pressure for a grid cell.

	=	the maximum capillary pressure from the [PCG](#__RefHeading___Toc77040_621662414) array for a given cell.

	=	the capillary pressure in the drainage capillary pressure table

allocated to the grid block.

	=	the maximum capillary pressure in the drainage capillary pressure table

allocated to the grid block at .


#### Example


```
--
--       DEFINE GRID BLOCK PCG DATA FOR ALL CELLS (BASED ON NX x NY x NZ = 300)
--
PCG
         100*50.0  100*75.0  100*125.0                                         /
```

The above example defines the [PCW](#__RefHeading___Toc84164_621662414) for 300 cells in the model as defined by the [DIMENS](#__RefHeading___Toc20387_2267116897) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section.

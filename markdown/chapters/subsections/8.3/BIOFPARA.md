#### Description

The [BIOFPARA](#REF_HEADING_KEYWORD_BIOFPARA) keyword defines parameters for models including biofilms. For the parameters, biomass means both suspended microbes in the water phase (labeled as microbial) and biofilm. Currently the two available models with biofilm effects are the [BIOFILM](#REF_HEADING_KEYWORD_BIOFILM) and the MICP model. See Landa-Marbán et al [Landa-Marbán, D., Tveit, S., Kumar, K., Gasda, S.E., 2021. Practical approaches to study microbially induced calcite precipitation at the field scale. Int. J. Greenh. Gas Control 106, 103256. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijggc.2021.103256.] and  [Landa-Marbán, D., Kumar, K., Tveit, S., Gasda, S.E., 2021.

(Eds) Short Papers from the 11th International Trondheim CCS conference, ISBN: 978-82-536-1714-5, 284-290.] for further information on the MICP model parameters, which are also used in the [BIOFILM](#REF_HEADING_KEYWORD_BIOFILM) model.

### TRACER – Define Passive Tracer Variables


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The TRACER keyword defines a series of passive tracers that are associated with a phase (oil, water, or gas) in the model. The maximum number of tracers for each phase are declared on the TRACERS keyword in the RUNSPEC section.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | Metric | Laboratory |  |
| 1 | NAME | A three letter character string defining the tracer’s name. NAME is used by the TNUM keyword in the REGIONS section, and unlike other keywords, the TNUM keyword itself must be concatenated with the phase and the name of the tracer defined by NAME. Similarly for the TVDP keyword in the SOLUTION section, where the TVDP keyword itself must be concatenated with the either letter F (for free) or S (for solution), followed by the name of the tracer defined by NAME. Note it is best to void names beginning with the letters F, S, and T as these names may create naming issues in post-processing software. | None |
| 2 | PHASE | A three letter character string that defines the tracer given by NAME to a particular fluid phase. The character should be set to OIL, WAT or GAS. | None |
| 3 | UNITS | The units for the tracer. This can be any unit but should be consistent with values entered via the TBLK and TVDP keywords in the SOLUTION section.  The default values are the same as the PHASE in the model. | Same as the phases in the model |
| Liquid: stb Gas: Mscf | Liquid: sm3 Gas: sm3 | Liquid: scc Gas: scc |  |
| 4 | SOLPHASE | A three or four letter character string defining the partitioned tracer’s solution phase. The character string should be set to OIL, WAT, GAS or MULT. Note that SOLPHASE only needs to be defined if the partitioned tracer option has been activate with the PARTTRAC keyword in the RUNSPEC section. | None |
| 5 | KPNUM | The table number to be used with the partitioned tracers defined by the PARTTRAC, TRACERKP and TRACERKM keywords. Note that KPNUM only needs to be defined if the partitioned tracer option has been activate with the PARTTRAC keyword in the RUNSPEC section. | None |
| 6 | ADSPHASE | A three letter character string defining the phase used for the adsorption calculation for when the MULT option has been for SOLPHASE. The character string should be set to OIL, WAT, GAS or ALL. Note that ADSPHASE only needs to be defined if the partitioned tracer option has been activate with the PARTTRAC keyword in the RUNSPEC section. | None |
| Notes: |  |  |  |

See also the TNUM keyword in the REGION section that defines tracer regions, and the TVDP keyword in the SOLUTION section that sets the initial tracer saturation for all the cells as a function of depth.


#### Example


```
--
--       DEFINE TRACER NAMES
--
--       TRACER   TRACER
--       NAME     PHASE
--       ------   ------
TRACER
        'IGS'     'GAS'                                    / GAS INJECTOR
        'DGS'     'GAS'                                    / DISOLVED GAS
        'IW1'     'WAT'                                    / WAT INJECTOR 1
        'Iw2'     'WAT'                                    / WAT INJECTOR 2
/

```

The above example defines four passive tracers one for a gas injection well, one for tracking the dissolved gas, and two to track the injected water from two water injection wells.

#### Description

This keyword, [TRACERKM](#__RefHeading___Toc1279805_4250154414), defines the Multi-Partitioned Tracer option K(P) tables, for when the Partitioned Tracer option has been activate with the [PARTTRAC](#__RefHeading___Toc264979_2928331029) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section, and the SOLPHASE parameter on the [TRACER](#__RefHeading___Toc121485_83452205) keyword in the [PROPS](#__RefHeading___Toc39329_784232322) section has been set to MULT to activate the Multi-Partitioned Tracer option.  Multi-partitioned tracers can partition into any number of phases (oil, water, gas etc.) and have adsorption, decay and diffusion parameters specific to each phase; whereas the standard partitioned tracers only have a “free” and “solution” phases. For the [TRACERKM](#__RefHeading___Toc1279805_4250154414) keyword the K(P) tables relate the ratio of the reference phase to the other phases versus pressure. So for example, given a multi-partitioned tracer in oil, water and gas, with the water phase acting as the reference phase, then [TRACERKM](#__RefHeading___Toc1279805_4250154414) would consist of columnar vectors of:


|  | (8.92) |
| --- | --- |

Where:

		= multi-partitioned oil-water K(P)

		= multi-partitioned gas-water K(P)

		= oil concentration

		= gas concentration

		= water concentration


See also the [TRACERKP](#__RefHeading___Toc1279807_4250154414) keyword in the [PROPS](#__RefHeading___Toc39329_784232322) section that provides similar data for standard partitioned tracers.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

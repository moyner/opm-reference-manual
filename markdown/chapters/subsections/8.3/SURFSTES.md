#### Description

The [SURFSTES](#__RefHeading___Toc1173153_4250154414) keyword defines surfactant water-oil surface tension versus surfactant concentration in the water phase tables, used in adjusting the pressure independent capillary pressure vectors in the [SWFN](#__RefHeading___Toc106882_335817223) or [SWOF](#__RefHeading___Toc45811_7190362561) saturation tables, entered by their respective keywords in the [PROPS](#__RefHeading___Toc39329_784232322) section. [SURFSTES](#__RefHeading___Toc1173153_4250154414) is also used to adjust the relative permeability curves on the aforementioned tables via the capillary number.  The Surfactant option must have been activated by the SURFACTANT keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section to use this keyword and either this keyword or the [SURFST](#__RefHeading___Toc1173151_4250154414) keyword, also in the [PROPS](#__RefHeading___Toc39329_784232322) section, is obligatory in this case. In addition, the [BRINE](#__RefHeading___Toc162083_289573908) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section must be activated and the [ESSNODE](#__RefHeading___Toc253956_803326780) keyword in the [PROPS](#__RefHeading___Toc39329_784232322) section must be used to define the salt concentration or the effective salinity.


See also the SURFSTS that defines the surfactant water-oil surface tension as a function of surfactant concentration in the water phase only.


This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

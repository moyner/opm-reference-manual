### SGL – End-Point Scaling Grid Cell Connate Gas Saturations


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

SGL defines the connate gas saturation for all the cells in the model via an array when the end-point scaling option has been invoked via the ENDSCALE keyword in the RUNSPEC section. The connate gas saturation is defined as the minimum gas saturation in a two-phase gas relative permeability table.

The keyword can be used with all grid types.

| 1 | SGL | SGL is an array of real numbers assigning the connate gas saturation values to each cell in the model. The number of entries should correspond to the NX x NY x NZ parameters on the DIMENS keyword. Repeat counts may be used, for example 30*0.03 | Taken from cell allocated relative permeability table. |

*Table 8.149: SGL Keyword Description*


End-point scaling allows the entered relative permeability functions to be re-scaled based on the saturation end-points allocated to each cell by the SWL, SWCR, SWU, SGL, SGCR, SGU, SOWCR, and SOGCR  saturation grid arrays for the saturation end-points, and the KRG, KRORG, KRORW and KRW relative permeability grid cell arrays for the relative permeability end-point data. In addition end-point scaling may be directional dependent in which case the directional dependent versions of the aforementioned arrays should be used, that is SGLX, SGLY and SGLZ instead of SGL. There is also the facility to make the directional end-point scaling reversible or non-reversible and if the non-reversible option is selected the non-reversible versions of the aforementioned arrays should be used, that is SGLX, SGLX-, SGLY, SGLY-, SGLZ and SGLZ-,  instead of the SGL keyword.


#### Example


```
--
--       DEFINE GRID BLOCK END-POINT SGL DATA FOR ALL CELLS
–       (FOR NX x NY x NZ = 300)
--
SGL
         300*0.030                                                              /

```

The above example defines a constant connate gas saturation of 0.03 to all 300 cells in the model as defined by the DIMENS keyword in the RUNSPEC section.

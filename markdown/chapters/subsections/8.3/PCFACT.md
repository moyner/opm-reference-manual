#### Description

[PCFACT](#REF_HEADING_KEYWORD_PCFACT_8_3) defines the capillary pressure multiplication factor due to a change in porosity. Currently the keyword is used in conjunction with OPM Flow’s Salt Precipitation model, in which the pore space is reduced due to salt precipitating in the pore space, causing a reduction in porosity and an associated increase in capillary pressure.


| Note This is an OPM Flow specific keyword for the simulator’s Salt Precipitation model that is activated by the [BRINE](#__RefHeading___Toc162083_289573908) and [PRECSALT](#__RefHeading___Toc332782_3149455253) keywords and declaring that vaporized water is present in the run via the [VAPWAT](#__RefHeading___Toc317543_3149455253) keyword. All three keywords are in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section. |

The capillary pressure factor data can be estimated from the permeability and porosity factors defined by the [PERMFACT](#__RefHeading___Toc712146_1466963378) keyword in the [PROPS](#__RefHeading___Toc39329_784232322) section using the Leverett J-function, for example:


|  | (8.3.199.2) |
| --- | --- |

Where:

,  	=	the initial and scaled porosity,

,  	=	the initial and scaled permeability, and

,  	=	the initial and scaled capillary pressure.


#### Example

The example below defines two [PCFACT](#REF_HEADING_KEYWORD_PCFACT_8_3) tables assuming NTSFUN equals two and NSSFUN is greater than or equal to five on the [TABDIMS](#__RefHeading___Toc89327_327352552) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section.

#### Description

The [DIFFC](#__RefHeading___Toc314077_1539708736) keyword defines the molecular weight of the fluids and diffusion coefficients between phases for each PVT region, for when the Molecular Diffusion option has been activated by the [DIFFUSE](#__RefHeading___Toc349951_1539708736) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section. This keyword is optional as OPM Flow will automatically calculate the coefficients, as described by Sandve et al. [Tor Harald Sandve1, Sarah E. Gasda, Atgeirr Rasmussen, and Alf Birger Rustad. Convective dissolution in field scale CO2 storage simulation using the OPM Flow simulator. Submitted to TCCS 11 – Trondheim Conference on CO2 Capture, Transport and Storage Trondheim, Norway – June 21-23, 2021.], if the [DIFFC](#__RefHeading___Toc314077_1539708736) keyword is absent from the input deck.  The keyword thus allows one to overwrite the automatically calculated values.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |

| 1 | OILMW | OILMW is a real positive number that specifies the molecular weight of the oil in the given PVT region. | None |
| lb/lb-M | kg/kg-M | gm/gm-M |  |
| 2 | GASMW | GASMW is a real positive number that defines the molecular weight of the gas in the given PVT region. | None |
| lb/lb-M | kg/kg-M | gm/gm-M |  |
| 3 | GASGASDF | A real positive number that defines the gas in gas diffusion coefficient in the given PVT region. | None |

See also the [DIFFUSE](#__RefHeading___Toc349951_1539708736) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section to activate the Molecular Diffusion option.


#### Example

The example below is based on field units, with NTPVT equal to three on the [TABDIMS](#__RefHeading___Toc89327_327352552) keyword.

```


Here the third PVT region has no values for the various oil related diffusion coefficients.

#### Description

The [SALINITY](#__RefHeading___Toc405185_1616145207) keyword defines a uniform salinity for all cells in the model. The keyword should only be used with OPM Flow’s CO2-Brine model which is activated via the [CO2STORE](#__RefHeading___Toc387968_1616145207) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section. This keyword is a compositional keyword in the commercial simulator but has been implemented in OPM Flow’s black-oil CO2-Brine model.

| 1 | [SALINITY](#__RefHeading___Toc405185_1616145207) | A real positive value that defines the salinity for all grid blocks in the model for when the CO2-Brine model has been activated. Note that the units for salinity are molality, that is gm-M/Kg, and therefore   the units are defined as given below with the 10-3 prefix. |  |  |  |
| 10-3 x lb-M/lb | 10-3 x kg-M/kg | 10-3 x gm-M/gm |  |  |  |

#### Example

The example sets the salt salinity for all cells in the model to 0.001 lb-M/Ib.


```
--
--       SET SALINITY FOR ALL CELLS (OPM FLOW KEYWORD)
--
SALINITY
         1.0                                               /
```

Note that units for salinity are to the 10-3, that is a value of 0.001 lb-M/lb should be entered as 1.0 (10-3 x lb-M/lb), as per the example.

#### Description

[SSOGCR](#__RefHeading___Toc817831_4250154414) defines the surfactant critical oil saturation for all the cells in the model via an array when the end-point scaling option has been invoked via the [ENDSCALE](#__RefHeading___Toc68146_2267116897) keyword and the surfactant phase has been activated by the [SURFACT](#__RefHeading___Toc863854_4250154414) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section. The critical oil saturation with respect to gas is defined as the maximum oil saturation for which the oil relative permeability is zero in a two-phase gas-oil relative permeability table.  [SSOGCR](#__RefHeading___Toc817831_4250154414) scales the surfactant oil relative permeability to gas data.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

| 1 | [SSOGCR](#__RefHeading___Toc817831_4250154414) | [SSOGCR](#__RefHeading___Toc817831_4250154414) is an array of real numbers assigning the surfactant critical oil saturation with respect to gas values to each cell in the model. The number of entries should correspond to the NX x NY x NZ parameters on the [DIMENS](#__RefHeading___Toc20387_2267116897) keyword. Repeat counts may be used, for example 30*0.30 dimensionless | Taken from cell allocated relative permeability table. |
| dimensionless | dimensionless | dimensionless |  |

End-point scaling allows the entered surfactant relative permeability functions to be re-scaled based on the saturation end-points allocated to each cell by the [SSWL](#__RefHeading___Toc837484_4250154414), [SSWCR](#__RefHeading___Toc837495_4250154414), [SSWU](#__RefHeading___Toc837482_4250154414), [SSGL](#__RefHeading___Toc811291_4250154414), [SSGCR](#__RefHeading___Toc811289_4250154414), SSGU, [SSOWCR](#__RefHeading___Toc830913_4250154414), and [SSOGCR](#__RefHeading___Toc817831_4250154414) saturation grid arrays for the saturation end-points, and the SKRG, SKROG, SKROW and [SKRW](#__RefHeading___Toc537530_38555213) relative permeability grid cell arrays for the relative permeability end-point data.


#### Example


```
--
--       DEFINE GRID BLOCK END-POINT SSOGCR DATA FOR ALL CELLS
--       (FOR NX x NY x NZ = 300)
--
SSOGCR
         300*0.200                                                              /

```

The above example defines a surfactant constant critical oil saturation with respect to gas of 0.20 to all 300 cells in the model as defined by the [DIMENS](#__RefHeading___Toc20387_2267116897) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section.

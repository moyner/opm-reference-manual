### SALTMF – Define the Salt Liquid-Phase Mole Fraction for All Cells


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The SALTMF keyword defines a uniform salt liquid-phase mole fraction for all cells in the model. The keyword should only be used with OPM Flow’s CO2-Brine model which is activated via the CO2STORE keyword in the RUNSPEC section.

This is an OPM Flow specific keyword.

See also the CO2STORE keyword in the RUNSPEC section.


#### Example

The example sets the salt liquid-phase mole fraction for all cells in the model to 0.018.


```
--
--       SET SALT LIQUID-PHASE MOLE FRACTION FOR ALL CELLS (OPM FLOW KEYWORD)
--
SALTMF
         0.018                                             /
```

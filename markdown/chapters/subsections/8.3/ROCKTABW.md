### ROCKTABW – Rock Compaction Tables (Water Induced)


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The ROCKTABW keyword defines the rock compaction tables induced by increasing water saturation within a grid cell due to water invasion, for when the rock compaction option has been invoked by the ROCKCOMP keyword in the RUNSPEC section. ROCKTABW defines pore volume and transmissibility multipliers versus water saturation that are used in the compaction calculations. The keyword should be used together with the ROCK, ROCKTAB or ROCKTABH keywords that specify the pore volume and transmissibility multipliers as functions of pressure. Alternatively the ROCKWNOD, ROCK2D and ROCK2DTR keywords can be used to enter two dimensional tables of the data. All keywords are in the PROPS section.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

#### Description

TPAMEPS defines the volumetric strain versus coal gas concentration tables, for when the Coal Bed Methane option has been activated via the COAL keyword, and PALM-MAN has been declared for the ROCKOPT variable on the ROCKCOMP keyword; both keywords are in the RUNSPEC section. The Palmer-Mansoorii^[Palmer, I. and Mansoori, J. “How Permeability Depends on Stress and Pore Pressure in Coalbeds: A New Model,” paper SPE 52607, SPE Reservoir Evaluation & Engineering (1998) 1, No. 6, 539-544.] and ^[Clarkson, C.R., Pan, Z., Palmer, I. and Harpalani, S. "Predicting Sorption-Induced Strain and Permeability Increase With Depletion for Coalbed-Methane Reservoirs", SPE 114778-PA, SPE Journal (2010) 15, No. 1, 152–159.]  rock model is used to calculate the impact on pore volume and permeability due to rock compaction.

See also the ROCKPARMA keyword in the PROPS section that defines the Palmer-Mansoori parameters.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

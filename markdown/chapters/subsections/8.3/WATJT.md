#### Description

[WATJT](#__RefHeading___Toc163486_254534176112) activates the water Joule-Thomson effect [The Joule–Thomson coefficient is defined as the change in temperature with respect to an increase in pressure at constant enthalpy.] in temperature calculations, and defines the water Joule-Thomson Coefficient (“JTC”) at a given reference pressure, for when OPM Flow’s thermal option has been activated by the [THERMAL](#__RefHeading___Toc137276_650382403) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979).


| Note This is an OPM Flow keyword used with OPM Flow’s black-oil thermal model, that is not available in the commercial simulator’s black-oil thermal formulation. |
| --- |


This keyword can only be used if OPM Flow’s thermal option has been activated by the [THERMAL](#__RefHeading___Toc137276_650382403) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section. Note this is different to the commercial simulator that uses the [TEMP](#__RefHeading___Toc146397_3544483072) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section to activate the black-oil thermal model, and does not include the Joule-Thomson effect in temperature calculations.

| 1 | PRESS | A real positive value that defines the reference pressure for the corresponding Joule-Thomson Coefficient, WATJTC. | None |
| psia | barsa | atma |  |
| 2 | WATJTC | WATJTC is a real positive or negative value that defines the water phase Joule-Thomson Coefficient. If the value is defaulted (1*) or set to 0, then WATJTC is internally calculated using thermal water density data on the WATSDENT keyword in the [PROPS](#__RefHeading___Toc39329_784232322) section. If a non-zero value is specified, then the WATJTC is assumed to be constant and equal to that value. | 0 |

The Joule–Thomson effect is when a real gas, as oppose to an ideal gas, expands, resulting in the temperature of the gas dropping [Natural Gas Engineering (McGraw-Hill chemical engineering series), Donald L. Katz, Robert l Lee, McGraw-Hill Education, 1990 (ISBN 0071007776, 9780071007771).]. For liquids the effect is the opposite, that is the internal energy is transferred to kinetic energy with a corresponding increase in temperature as velocity increases.

Thermodynamically, the Joule–Thomson coefficient is defined as the isenthalpic [An isenthalpic process or isoenthalpic process, is a process that proceeds without any change in enthalpy, H; or specific enthalpy, h.] change in temperature in a fluid caused by a unitary pressure drop, as shown in the following equation:

Which can also express as [Pippard, A.B.: Elements of Classical Thermodynamics: For Advanced Students of Physics. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK (1957)]:


|  | (8.99) |
| --- | --- |

Setting the gravity term, , to zero we have:


|  | (8.100) |
| --- | --- |

Where:

	=	Joule–Thomson coefficient (oC/Pa),

	=	thermal expansivity at constant pressure (1/oC),

	= 	specific heat at constant pressure (J/kg oC),

	= 	gravitational acceleration (m/s2)

	= 	pressure (Pa),

 	= 	temperature (oC), and

 	= 	height (m).


#### Example

The following example shows the [WATJT](#__RefHeading___Toc163486_254534176112) keyword for when the thermal option has been activated by the [THERMAL](#__RefHeading___Toc137276_650382403) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section, and for when NTPVT on the [TABDIMS](#__RefHeading___Toc89327_327352552) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section is set equal to two.

Here the first entry is defaulted, and the simulator will therefore calculate the water JTC internally using the data on the [WATDENT](#__RefHeading___Toc173954_2545341761) keyword in the [PROPS](#__RefHeading___Toc39329_784232322) section.

There is no terminating “/” for this keyword.

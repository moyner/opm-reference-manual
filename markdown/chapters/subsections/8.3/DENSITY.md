#### Description

[DENSITY](#__RefHeading___Toc45799_719036256) defines the oil, water and gas surface densities for the fluids for various regions in the model. The number of [DENSITY](#__RefHeading___Toc45799_719036256) vector data sets is defined by the NTPVT parameter on the [TABDIMS](#__RefHeading___Toc89327_327352552) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section and the allocation of the [DENSITY](#__RefHeading___Toc45799_719036256) data sets to different grid blocks in the model is done via the [PVTNUM](#__RefHeading___Toc68366_2752266063) keyword in the [REGIONS](#__RefHeading___Toc40648_784232322) section. One data set consists of one record or line which is terminated by a “/”.  The surface density or gravity must be entered using either the [DENSITY](#__RefHeading___Toc45799_719036256) or [GRAVITY](#__RefHeading___Toc45801_719036256) keywords irrespective of which phases are active in the model.

*Table 8.26: DENSITY Keyword Description*


Note that provided the first table has been entered, subsequent tables may be defaulted, in this case the prior table is copied to the current table. See the third example for an illustration on how to use this feature.

According to the SPE SI standard [The SI Metric System of Units and SPE Metric Standard, Adopted for Use as a Voluntary Standard by the SPE Board of Directors, June 1983, Society of Petroleum Engineers.], Relative Density (γ) replaces Specific Gravity as the term used to define the ratio of the density of a known material to the density of reference material, at standard conditions of pressure and temperature. Standard conditions vary throughout the world, but for oil field units one normally uses14.7 psia and 60 oF, whereas for SI units some areas use 101.325 kPa and 15 oC.

See also the [GRAVITY](#__RefHeading___Toc45801_719036256) keyword in the [PROPS](#__RefHeading___Toc39329_784232322) section, that can be used to enter the relative density values instead of the density numbers.


#### Examples

The following shows the [DENSITY](#__RefHeading___Toc45799_719036256) keyword for when NTPVT on the [TABDIMS](#__RefHeading___Toc89327_327352552) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section is set to one.

The next example shows the [DENSITY](#__RefHeading___Toc45799_719036256) keyword for when NTPVT on the [TABDIMS](#__RefHeading___Toc89327_327352552) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section is set to three.

```


The third, and final, example shows the [DENSITY](#__RefHeading___Toc45799_719036256) keyword for when NTPVT on the [TABDIMS](#__RefHeading___Toc89327_327352552) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section is set to four. Here table two defaults to table one, and table four defaults to table three.


```

                                                           / PVT DATA REGION 2

Again, note that there is no terminating “/” for this keyword.

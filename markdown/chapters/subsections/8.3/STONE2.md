#### Description

This keyword activates Stone’s [Stone, H. L. “Estimation of Three-Phase Relative Permeability and Residual Oil Data,” Journal of Canadian Petroleum Technology (1973) 12, No. 4, 53-61.] second three phase oil relative permeability model as modified by Aziz and Settari [Aziz, K. and Settari, A. Petroleum Reservoir Simulation, London, UK, Applied Science Publishers (1979), page 398.].  If the [STONE](#__RefHeading___Toc157687_1371377330), [STONE1](#__RefHeading___Toc210162_2884651453) and [STONE2](#__RefHeading___Toc210166_2884651453) keywords are not present in the input deck then the default three phase oil relative permeability model is employed.  The [STONE2](#__RefHeading___Toc210166_2884651453) keyword should only be used in three phase runs containing the oil, gas and water phases.

There is no data required for this keyword.


#### Example


```
--
--       ACTIVATE STONE’S SECOND THREE PHASE RELATIVE PERMEABILITY MODEL
--
STONE2
```


The above example switches on the Modified Stone three phase relative permeability model.

#### Description

[PERMFACT](#__RefHeading___Toc712146_1466963378) defines the permeability multiplication factor due to a change in porosity. The keyword is used in conjunction with OPM Flow’s Salt Precipitation model, in which the pore space is reduced due to salt precipitating in the pore space, causing a reduction in porosity and an associated reduction in permeability. This keyword is also used for the [BIOFILM](#REF_HEADING_KEYWORD_BIOFILM) and [MICP](#__RefHeading___Toc383375_111689907) model, where the pore space is reduced due to biofilm formation, and for the [MICP](#__RefHeading___Toc383375_111689907) model, also due to calcite precipitation.

The porosity reduction can be written as a function proportional to the initial porosity, e.g., considering the volume fraction of salt () precipitated out of the vaporized water phase, that is:


|  | (8.71) |
| --- | --- |

The porosity and associated permeability factor data can be calculated using a permeability-porosity relationship, for example:


|  | (8.72) |
| --- | --- |

Where:

ko and 	=	the initial permeability and porosity,

k and 	=	the actual permeability and porosity that changes due to the model dynamics (e.g., precipitation or dissolution of  salt, biofilm formation, calcite precipitation),

	=	the residual porosity at which permeability is zero, and

	=	a positive exponent.

The example below defines two [PERMFACT](#__RefHeading___Toc712146_1466963378) tables assuming NTSFUN equals two and NSSFUN is greater than or equal to five on the [TABDIMS](#__RefHeading___Toc89327_327352552) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section.

Both tables use equation (8.72) with Φc equal to zero and ɣ equal to 2.0. Note that [PERMFACT](#__RefHeading___Toc712146_1466963378) changes the permeability in all three dimensions, that is the [PERMX](#__RefHeading___Toc45791_719036256), [PERMY](#__RefHeading___Toc45793_719036256) and [PERMZ](#__RefHeading___Toc45795_719036256) arrays are all modified.

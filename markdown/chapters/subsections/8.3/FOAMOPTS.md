#### Description

The [FOAMOPTS](#__RefHeading___Toc224982_3519154785) keyword defines the transport phase for the foam (gas, water or solvent) and how gas mobility reduction should be calculated for when the Foam option has been activated by the [FOAM](#__RefHeading___Toc171586_289573908) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | FOAMOPT1 | A defined character string that specifies the transport phase for the foam, and should be set to one of the following: | [GAS](#__RefHeading___Toc38607_2267116897) |
| 2 | FOAMOPT2 | A defined character string that specifies the method to be used to calculate the reduction in gas mobility, and should be set to one of the following: Only the default value of TAB is currently supported by OPM Flow. | TAB |

#### Example


```
--
--       FOAMOPT1  FOAMOPT2
--       PHASE     MOBILITY
--       --------  --------
FOAMOPTS
         GAS       TAB                                     / FOAM MODEL OPTIONS
```


The above example defines the transport phase is to be gas and the gas mobility reduction is to use a table as defined by the [FOAMMOB](#__RefHeading___Toc224978_3519154785) keyword as a function of foam concentration, the [FOAMMOBS](#__RefHeading___Toc311837_803326780) keyword as a function of shear, or as a function of pressure using the [FOAMMOBP](#__RefHeading___Toc311835_803326780) keyword.

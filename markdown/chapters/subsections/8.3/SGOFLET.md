The keyword is used as a replacement for the [SGOF](#__RefHeading___Toc106870_335817223) keyword for three-phase oil-gas-water systems, and the  LET series of keywords cannot be combined with the standard set of relative permeability keywords.

Note there a two versions of the LET functions, LET232 for two-phase flowing conditions and LETx [Lomeland F. and Ebeltoft E., 2013. Versatile Three-phase Correlations for Relative Permeability and Capillary Pressure. Paper SCA2013-034 presented at the International Symposium of the Society of Core Analysts held in Napa Valley, California, USA, 16-19 September, 2013.] for three-phase flowing conditions.  This keyword implements the LET version for a gas-oil system.

The functions are dependent on the drainage and imbibition cycle of the wetting phase as well as drainage and inhibition cycle number, since a reservoir may undergo several flooding events. To account for this the system defines the flooding event using the three saturations: Sw, So, and Sg together with the state of the three saturations during the flooding event. The saturation state can be Increasing, Decreasing, or Constant, for a given flooding event cycle number (n). Thus, Sw(D), So(I), Sg(C)1or DIC1, means the water phase is decreasing, the oil phase is increasing and the gas phase is constant for the primary or first cycle (n equals one). This is case for when oil is migrating into the reservoir rock and displacing the initial water contained with the reservoir.


| Note All the LET parameters are dependent on the flooding event and flooding cycle, and thus are expected vary as such. To be clear, the values of [SGCR](#__RefHeading___Toc20428_784232322), Lg, Lo etc. should be different for each flooding cycle. |

#### Description

SWGFLET defines the relative permeability and capillary pressure parameters for the water-gas LET family of models. Both the gas and water phases should be made active in the model via the [GAS](#__RefHeading___Toc38607_2267116897) and [WATER](#__RefHeading___Toc38611_2267116897) keywords in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section. This keyword should only be used in two-phase models containing the gas and water phases only, that is the oil phase must be absent.  See section [8.2.6](#8.2.6.Saturation Table Generation - LET Functions|outline)[Saturation Table Generation - LET Functions](#8.2.6.Saturation Table Generation - LET Functions|outline) and Lomeland et al.

The keyword is used as a replacement for the [SGWFN](#__RefHeading___Toc106872_335817223) keyword for two-phase gas-water systems, and the LET series of keywords cannot be combined with the standard set of relative permeability keywords.

Note there a two versions of the LET functions, LET237 for two-phase flowing conditions and LETx [Lomeland F. and Ebeltoft E., 2013. Versatile Three-phase Correlations for Relative Permeability and Capillary Pressure. Paper SCA2013-034 presented at the International Symposium of the Society of Core Analysts held in Napa Valley, California, USA, 16-19 September, 2013.] for three-phase flowing conditions.  This keyword implements the LET version for a gas-water system.

The functions are dependent on the drainage and imbibition cycle of the wetting phase as well as drainage and inhibition cycle number, since a reservoir may undergo several flooding events. To account for this the system defines the flooding event using the three saturations: Sw, So, and Sg together with the state of the three saturations during the flooding event. The saturation state can be Increasing, Decreasing, or Constant, for a given flooding event cycle number (n). Thus, Sw(D), So(C), Sg(I), or DCI1, means the water phase is decreasing, the oil phase is constant and the gas phase is increasing for the primary or first cycle (n equals one). This is case for when gas is migrating into the reservoir rock and displacing the initial water contained with the reservoir.


| Note All the LET parameters are dependent on the flooding event and flooding cycle, and thus are expected vary as such. To be clear, the values of [SWCR](#__RefHeading___Toc27248_784232322), Lg, Lw etc. should be different for each flooding cycle. |

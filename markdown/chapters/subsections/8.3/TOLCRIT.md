#### Description

Critical fluid saturations are determined from the relative permeability tables, that is the last saturation in a relative permeability table where the relative permeability of a phase is set equal to zero. Since floating-point numbers (as implemented in computers) are never exact, one cannot compare floating point numbers for exact equality.  Thus, this keyword defines a value below which is considered equivalent to zero in determining the critical saturation for a phase.

| 1 | TOLCRIT | TOLCRIT is a real positive number greater than zero and less than one that defines the critical saturation tolerance used to determine the critical saturation of a fluid in the relative permeability tables. The default value of 1 x 10-6 means that relative permeabilty values less than this value will be treated as being equal to zero. | 1 x 10-6 |

: TOLCRIT Keyword Description {#tbl-8-193}
See also section 8.2.4 Saturation Tables (Relative Permeability and Capillary Pressure Tables) for a description of the relative permeability tables and the various end-point definitions, including oil, water and gas critical saturations.


#### Example


```
---
--       SET THE CRITICAL SATURATION TOLERANCE
--
TOLCRIT
         1.0E-6                                                                /

```

The above example defines the critical saturation tolerance to be the default value of 1 x 10-6.

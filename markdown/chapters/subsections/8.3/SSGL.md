### SSGL – End-Point Scaling Grid Cell Surfactant Connate Gas Saturations


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

SSGL defines the surfactant connate gas saturation for all the cells in the model via an array when the end-point scaling option has been invoked via the ENDSCALE keyword and the surfactant phase has been activated by the SURFACT keyword in the RUNSPEC section. The connate gas saturation is defined as the minimum gas saturation in a two-phase gas relative permeability table.  SSGL is used to scale the surfactant oil and water relative permeability data.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

| 1 | SSGL | SSGL is an array of real numbers assigning the surfactant connate gas saturation values to each cell in the model. The number of entries should correspond to the NX x NY x NZ parameters on the DIMENS keyword. Repeat counts may be used, for example 30*0.03 | Taken from cell allocated relative permeability table. |

*Table 8.174: SSGL Keyword Description*


End-point scaling allows the entered surfactant relative permeability functions to be re-scaled based on the saturation end-points allocated to each cell by the SSWL, SSWCR, SSWU, SSGL, SSGCR, SSGU, SSOWCR, and SSOGCR saturation grid arrays for the saturation end-points, and the SKRG, SKROG, SKROW and SKRW relative permeability grid cell arrays for the relative permeability end-point data.


#### Example


```
--
--       DEFINE GRID BLOCK END-POINT SSGL DATA FOR ALL CELLS
--       (FOR NX x NY x NZ = 300)
--
SSGL
         300*0.030                                                              /

```

The above example defines a constant surfactant connate gas saturation of 0.03 to all 300 cells in the model as defined by the DIMENS keyword in the RUNSPEC section.

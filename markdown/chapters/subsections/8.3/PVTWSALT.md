### PVTWSALT – Define Brine Water Fluid Properties for Various Regions


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

PVTWSALT defines the brine water properties for various regions in the model, for when the brine phase has been activated by the BRINE keyword in the RUNSPEC section.  In this case PVTWSALT is used instead of PVTW in the input file.  However, if the ECLMC keyword has been entered in the RUNSPEC section to invoke the Multi-Component Brine model, the PVTW keyword should be used instead of PVTWSALT, as with this combination the salinity effect on the density is ignored.

The number of PVTWSALT table data sets is defined by the NTPVT parameter on the TABDIMS keyword in the RUNSPEC section and the allocation of the PVTWSALT tables to different grid blocks in the model is done via the PVTNUM keyword in the REGION section.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | :------ | --- |
| Field | Metric | Laboratory |  |
| 1-1 | PRESS | Single real positive value that defines the reference pressure for the data in the following records (Pref). PRESS should be approximately equal to the average reservoir pressures in the model. The simulator uses the previous time step values to forecast the current  time step water properties by linear interpolation. If PRESS is not representative of the average reservoir pressures in the model then the linear interpolation might result in nonphysical values of the water saturation and water viscosity. | None |
| psia | barsa | atma |  |
| 1-2 | SALTSURF | A real value that defines the reference salt concentration in the solution in the surface stock tank water (Cs, ref) If defaulted SALTSURF is taken as the minimum salt concentration entered in the SALTCON columnar vector in the second record for this keyword.  This should be in most cases be zero. | Defined |

| lb/stb | kg/sm3 | gm/scc |  |
| 1-3 | / | Record terminated by a “/” | Not Applicable |
| 2-1 | SALTCON | A columnar vector of real monotonically increasing values that defines the salt concentration in the solution (Cs). | None |
| lb/stb | kg/sm3 | gm/scc |  |
| 2-2 | WFVF | WFVF is a real columnar vector defining the water formation volume factor (Bw) at the reference pressure PRESS, for the corresponding salt concentration SALTCON. | None |
| 2-1 |  |  |  |
| rb/stb | rm3/sm3 | rcc/scc |  |
| 2-3 | WCOMP | WCOMP is a real columnar vector defining the water compressibility (Cw) at the water reference pressure PRESS, for the corresponding salt concentration SALTCON. The water compressibility is defined as: ${C}_{w} = -\frac{1}{{B}_{w}}(\frac{{\mathit{dB}}_{w}}{\mathit{dP}})$ | None |
| 1/psia | 1/bars | 1/atma |  |
| 2.4 | WVISC | WVISC is a real columnar vector defining the water viscosity (µw) at the water reference pressure PRESS, for the corresponding salt concentration SALTCON. | None |
| cP | cP | cP |  |
| 2.5 | WVISCOMP | WVISCOMP is a real columnar vector defining the water viscosibility (µwc) at the water reference pressure PRESS,  for the corresponding salt concentration SALTCON.  The water viscosibility is defined as: ${\mathrm{μ}}_{\mathit{wc}} = -\frac{1}{{\mathrm{μ}}_{w}}(\frac{d{\mathrm{μ}}_{w}}{\mathit{dP}})$ | None |

*Table 8.123: PVTWSALT Keyword Description*


As mentioned above, the simulator first calculates the water properties as functions of the salt concentration at the previous time step by linear interpolation in salt concentration for water compressibility (Cw), water viscosibility (μwc), $\frac{1}{{B}_{w}}$and$\frac{1}{{B}_{w} {μ}_{w}}$.  It then calculates the values of${B}_{w}$and${B}_{w} {μ}_{w}$at the current time step using the current pressure P, using the following equations:


$$
{B}_{w}(P,{C}_{s}) = \frac{{B}_{w}({P}_{\mathit{ref}},{C}_{s,\mathit{ref}})}{1 + {C}_{w}(P-{P}_{\mathit{ref}}) + \frac{{({C}_{w}(P-{P}_{\mathit{ref}}))}^{2}}{2}}
$$ {#eq-8-82}

and


$$
{B}_{w}(P,{C}_{s}) {\mathrm{μ}}_{w}(P,{C}_{s}) = \frac{{B}_{w}({P}_{\mathit{ref}},{C}_{s,\mathit{ref}}) {\mathrm{μ}}_{w}({P}_{\mathit{ref}},{C}_{s,\mathit{ref}})}{1 + ({C}_{w}- {\mathrm{μ}}_{\mathit{wc}})(P-{P}_{\mathit{ref}}) + \frac{{(({C}_{w}- {\mathrm{μ}}_{\mathit{wc}})(P-{P}_{\mathit{ref}}))}^{2}}{2}}
$$ {#eq-8-83}

See also the BDENSITY keyword in the PROPS section that defines the brine surface densities for the salt concentrations declared on the PVTWSALT keyword. Note that if the BDENSITY keyword is absent from the input file then the brine surface densities will be set to the water density values declared via the DENSITY keyword in the PROPS section. In this case there is no variation in brine surface density with respect to salt concentration.


#### Example

The following shows the PVTWSALT keyword for when NTPVT on the TABDIMS keyword in the RUNSPEC section is set equal to two and NPPVT is set to greater than four on the TABDIMS keyword.

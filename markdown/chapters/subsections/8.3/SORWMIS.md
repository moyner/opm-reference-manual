### SORWMIS – Miscible Residual Oil versus Water Saturation Functions


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

SORWMIS defines the dependency between the miscible residual oil saturation and the water saturation, for when the MISCIBLE keyword in the RUNSPEC section has been activated. The keyword can only be used with the MISCIBLE option and for when the oil, water and gas phases are active in the model.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | :------ | --- |
| Field | Metric | Laboratory |  |
| 1 | SWAT | A columnar vector of real monotonically increasing down the column   values starting from zero and terminating at one, that defines the water  saturation. | None |
| dimensionless | dimensionless | dimensionless |  |
| 2 | SORMIS | A columnar vector of real equal or increasing down the column values that are greater than or equal to zero and less than one,  that define the corresponding miscible residual oil saturation for the corresponding water saturation SWAT. | None |
| dimensionless | dimensionless | dimensionless |  |

The above example defines two miscible residual oil versus water saturation tables assuming NTMISC equals two and NSMISC is greater than or equal to three on the MISCIBLE keyword in the RUNSPEC section.

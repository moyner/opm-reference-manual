### CNAMES  –  Define Compositional Component Names


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The CNAMES keyword defines the names for each of the compositional components active in the model. The keyword should only be used if the compositional mode has been requested using the COMPS keyword in the RUNSPEC section.

OPM Flow does not currently support the general compositional modeling formulation.


::: {.callout-note}
This keyword is only supported by OPM Flow when the two phase gas-water CO2 storage model has been activated using the CO2STORE keyword and either the GASWAT or the GAS and WATER keywords in the RUNSPEC section. Only the component names "H2O", "CO2" and "NACL" (water, CO2 and salt respectively) are recognized when the CNAMES keyword is used with the CO2STORE keyword; any other component names are ignored.

| 1 | CNAMES | A series of character strings of up to eight characters in length that define the names for each of the compositional components active in the model. | None |

#### Example

The following example defines how to confirm a three component formulation, together with defining the names of the compositional components, to be used with the CO2STORE and GASWAT options.


```

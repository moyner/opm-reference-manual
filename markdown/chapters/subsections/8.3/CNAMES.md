#### Description

The [CNAMES](#__RefHeading___Toc27871_3671211675 Copy 1 Copy 1 Copy 1) keyword defines the names for each of the compositional components active in the model. The keyword should only be used if the compositional mode has been requested using the [COMPS](#__RefHeading___Toc27871_3671211675 Copy 1) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section.

OPM Flow does not currently support the general compositional modeling formulation.


| Note This keyword is only supported by OPM Flow when the two phase gas-water CO2 storage model has been activated using the [CO2STORE](#__RefHeading___Toc387968_1616145207) keyword and either the [GASWAT](#__RefHeading___Toc38607_2267116897 Copy 1) or the [GAS](#__RefHeading___Toc38607_2267116897) and [WATER](#__RefHeading___Toc38611_2267116897) keywords in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section. Only the component names "H2O", "CO2" and "NACL" (water, CO2 and salt respectively) are recognized when the [CNAMES](#__RefHeading___Toc27871_3671211675 Copy 1 Copy 1 Copy 1) keyword is used with the [CO2STORE](#__RefHeading___Toc387968_1616145207) keyword; any other component names are ignored. |

#### Example

The following example defines how to confirm a three component formulation, together with defining the names of the compositional components, to be used with the [CO2STORE](#__RefHeading___Toc387968_1616145207) and [GASWAT](#__RefHeading___Toc38607_2267116897 Copy 1) options.

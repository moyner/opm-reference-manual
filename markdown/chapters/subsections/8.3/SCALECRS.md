### SCALECRS – Define End-Point Scaling Option


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The SCALECRS keyword sets the end-point scaling option to be either two-point or three-point scaling, for when the End-Point Scaling option has been invoked by the ENDSCALE keyword in the RUNSPEC section.   This determines which end-points on the relative permeability curves are used for scaling based on the supplied end-point arrays (SGCR, SWCR, etc.).


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | SCALEOPT | SCALEOPT is a character string that sets the end-point scaling option and should be set to either NO or YES: | NO |
| Notes: |  |  |  |

*Table 8.143: SCALECRS Keyword Description*


The end-point scaled for each option and the arrays used in the end-point scaling are summarized in the following table:


| Option | Phases | Relative Permeability End-Point | Minimum Saturation End-Point | Middle Saturation End-Point | Maximum Saturation End-Point |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Two-Point | Water | KRW | SWCR |  | SWU |
| Gas | KRG | SGCR |  | SGU |  |
| Oil-Water | KRORW | SOWCR |  | (1.0 – SWL - SGL) |  |
| Oil-Gas | KRORG | SOGCR |  | (1.0 – SWL - SGL) |  |
| Three-Point | Water | KRW | SWCR | (1.0 – SOWCR - SGL) | SWU |
| Gas | KRG | SGCR | (1.0 - SOGCR-SWL) | SGU |  |
| Oil-Water | KRORW | SOWCR | (1.0 – SWCR - SGL) | (1.0 – SWL - SGL) |  |
| Oil-Gas | KRORG | SOGCR | (1.0 – SGCR - SGL) | (1.0 – SWL - SGL) |  |
| Two Phase Gas-Water Simulations |  |  |  |  |  |
| Water | KRW | SWCR | (1.0 - SGCR) | SWU |  |
| Gas | KRG | SGCR | (1.0 -SWCR) | SGU |  |

*Table 8.144: End-Point Arrays Used in the End-Point Scaling Options*


See also the TZONE keyword in the PROPS section that sets the transition zone end-point scaling options for the oil, gas and water phases.


#### Example


```
--
--       TWO-POINT END-POINT SCALING IS NO THREE POINT IS YES
--
--       SCALEOPT
--       ---------
SCALECRS
         YES                                               / SCALING OPTION
```

The above example activates three-point end-point scaling of the relative permeability curves.

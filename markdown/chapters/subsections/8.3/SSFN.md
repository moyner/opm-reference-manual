#### Description

The [SSFN](#__RefHeading___Toc106880_335817223) keyword defines the miscible normalized relative permeability tables for when the [SOLVENT](#__RefHeading___Toc62787_1778172979) option has been activated in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section using the respective keyword.  The [SOLVENT](#__RefHeading___Toc62787_1778172979) keyword results in a four component model (oil, water and gas, plus a solvent). This keyword should only be used if the [SOLVENT](#__RefHeading___Toc62787_1778172979) option has been activated.

| Field | Metric | Laboratory |  |
| 1 | [SGAS](#__RefHeading___Toc137369_1317547213) | A columnar vector of real monotonically increasing down the column values starting from zero and terminating at one, that defines the gas plus solvent saturation ration which is defined as either: or Where Sg is the gas saturation and Ss is the solvent saturation. | None |
| dimensionless | dimensionless | dimensionless |  |
| 2 | KRGt | A columnar vector of real values that are either equal or increasing down the column and that are greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to one that defines the gas relative permeability. The resulting gas relative permeability is calculated from: where krgt is the data in this column and krgt is the gas relative permeability from the [SGFN](#__RefHeading___Toc106868_335817223) keyword. | None |
| dimensionless | dimensionless | dimensionless |  |
| 3 | KRSt | A columnar vector of real values that are either equal or increasing down the column and that are greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to one that defines the solvent relative permeability. The resulting solvent relative permeability is calculated from: where krSt is the data in this column and krgt is the gas relative permeability from the [SGFN](#__RefHeading___Toc106868_335817223) keyword. | None |

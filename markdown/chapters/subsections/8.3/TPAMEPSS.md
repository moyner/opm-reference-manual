#### Description

[TPAMEPSS](#__RefHeading___Toc1253039_4250154414) defines the volumetric strain versus coal solvent concentration tables, for when the Coal Bed Methane option has been activated via the [COAL](#__RefHeading___Toc234580_3519154785) keyword, and PALM-MAN has been declared for the ROCKOPT variable on the [ROCKCOMP](#__RefHeading___Toc55593_1778172979) keyword; both keywords are in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section. The Palmer-Mansoorii [Palmer, I. and Mansoori, J. “How Permeability Depends on Stress and Pore Pressure in Coalbeds: A New Model,” paper SPE 52607, SPE Reservoir Evaluation & Engineering (1998) 1, No. 6, 539-544.] and  [Clarkson, C.R., Pan, Z., Palmer, I. and Harpalani, S. "Predicting Sorption-Induced Strain and Permeability Increase With Depletion for Coalbed-Methane Reservoirs", SPE 114778-PA, SPE Journal (2010) 15, No. 1, 152–159.]  rock model is used to calculate the impact on pore volume and permeability due to rock compaction.

See also the ROCKPARMA keyword in the [PROPS](#__RefHeading___Toc39329_784232322) section that defines the Palmer-Mansoori parameters.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

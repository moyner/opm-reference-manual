#### Description

[IPCW](#__RefHeading___Toc84166_621662414) defines the maximum imbibition water-oil or water-gas capillary pressure values for all the cells in the model via an array.  The [ENDSCALE](#__RefHeading___Toc68146_2267116897) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section should be activated to enable end-point scaling and the use of this keyword. In addition, the HYSTER option on the [SATOPTS](#__RefHeading___Toc37029_327352552) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section has to be activated to invoke the hysteresis option. The keyword can be used with all grid types.

| 1 | [IPCW](#__RefHeading___Toc84166_621662414) | [IPCW](#__RefHeading___Toc84166_621662414) is an array of positive real numbers assigning the maximum imbibition water capillary pressure values for each cell in the model. Repeat counts may be used, for example 30*100.0. | None |

*Table 8.62: IPCW Keyword Description*


The capillary pressure for a grid block is scaled by:


|  | (8.60) |
| --- | --- |

Where:

	=	the resulting imbibition water capillary pressure for a grid cell.

	= 	the maximum capillary pressure from the [IPCW](#__RefHeading___Toc84166_621662414) array for a given cell.

	= 	the capillary pressure in the imbibition capillary pressure table

allocated to the grid block.

	= 	the maximum capillary pressure in the imbibition capillary pressure table

allocated to the grid block (that is at the connate water saturation).


See also the [PCW](#__RefHeading___Toc84164_621662414) keyword for the equivalent drainage functionality.


#### Example


```
--
--        DEFINE GRID BLOCK IPCW DATA FOR ALL CELLS (BASED ON NX x NY x NZ = 300)
--
IPCW
          100*50.0  100*75.0   100*125.0                                        /
```


The above example defines the [IPCW](#__RefHeading___Toc84166_621662414) for 300 cells in the model as defined by the [DIMENS](#__RefHeading___Toc20387_2267116897) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section.

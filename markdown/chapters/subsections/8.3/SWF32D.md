### SWF32D – Water Saturation Tables with Respect to Oil and Gas (Three Phase)


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |

#### Description

The SWF32D keyword defines the three phase water relative permeability versus oil and gas saturation tables for when oil, gas and water are present in the input deck.  The keyword should only be used if oil, gas and water are present in the input deck.  Normally the simulator calculates the three-phase oil relative permeabilities based on the entered two phase tables of water-oil and gas-oil, combined with the STONE1 and STONE2 keywords in the PROPS section that determine the method used to generate the thee phase water relative permeability curves.  SWF32D allows for the direct input of the three phase tables, as such the STONE1 and STONE2 keywords should not be entered if SWF32D is used in the input deck.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

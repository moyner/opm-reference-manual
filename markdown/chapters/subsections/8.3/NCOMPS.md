#### Description

This keyword confirms the maximum number of compositional components in the model, as such it should have the same number of components as that declared via the [COMPS](#__RefHeading___Toc27871_3671211675 Copy 1) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section. The keyword should only be used if the [CO2STORE](#__RefHeading___Toc387968_1616145207) keyword and either the [GASWAT](#__RefHeading___Toc38607_2267116897 Copy 1) or the [GAS](#__RefHeading___Toc38607_2267116897) and [WATER](#__RefHeading___Toc38611_2267116897) keywords in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section, have also be activated for the gas-water two component model.


| Note This is an OPM Flow keyword used with OPM Flow’s [CO2STORE](#__RefHeading___Toc387968_1616145207) and [GASWAT](#__RefHeading___Toc38607_2267116897 Copy 1) keywords in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section, and should not be confused with the more general version of the [NCOMPS](#__RefHeading___Toc27871_3671211675 Copy 1 Copy 1) keyword used in the commercial compositional simulator. Secondly, although OPM Flow parses the keyword, the simulator currently ignores the data for this keyword. |

| 1 | [NCOMPS](#__RefHeading___Toc27871_3671211675 Copy 1 Copy 1) | A positive integer defining the maximum number of compositional components in the model. Secondly the number of components must be the same as that enter via the [COMPS](#__RefHeading___Toc27871_3671211675 Copy 1) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section. Only the default value of two is currently supported by OPM Flow. | 2 |

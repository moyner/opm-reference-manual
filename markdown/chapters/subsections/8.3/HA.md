#### Description

The [HA](#__RefHeading___Toc279266_870710203) series of keywords defines the history match end-point gradient parameters used to set the additive cumulative end point data, for when the History Match Gradient option has been activated by the [HMDIMS](#__RefHeading___Toc207753_4219267791) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section.  In addition, the End-Point Scaling option must also be activated by the [ENDSCALE](#__RefHeading___Toc68146_2267116897) keyword which is also in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section. The keyword consists of the first two characters of “HA” followed by the end-point keyword shown in Table 8.45, for example, HASWL.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but has no effect on the results so it will be ignored.


| Type | End-Point Keyword | Oil-Water End-Point Definitions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Saturation | [SWL](#__RefHeading___Toc22881_7842323221) | Connate water saturation, that is the smallest water saturation in a water saturation function table. |
| [SWCR](#__RefHeading___Toc27248_784232322) | Critical water saturation, that is the largest water saturation for which the water relative permeability is zero. |  |
| [SOWCR](#__RefHeading___Toc30436_784232322) | Critical oil-in-water saturation, that is the largest oil saturation for which the oil relative permeability is zero in an oil-water system. |  |
| Relative Permeability | [KRW](#__RefHeading___Toc97397_621662414) | Relative permeability of water at the maximum water saturation (normally the maximum water saturation is one). |
| [KRO](#__RefHeading___Toc97395_621662414) | Relative permeability of oil at the maximum oil saturation. |  |
| [KRWR](#__RefHeading___Toc70193_335817223) | Relative permeability of water at the residual oil saturation or the residual gas saturation in a gas-water run. |  |
| [KRORW](#__RefHeading___Toc70191_335817223) | Relative permeability of oil at the critical water saturation. |  |
| Capillary Pressure | [SWLPC](#__RefHeading___Toc179514_1371377330) | Capillary pressure connate water saturation, that is the smallest water saturation in a water saturation function table. |
| Type | End-Point Keyword | Gas-Oil End-Point Definitions |

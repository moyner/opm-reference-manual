#### Description

The [PLYKRRF](#__RefHeading___Toc245845_501926209) keyword defines the polymer rock permeability reduction factor to the water phase by individual cell, for when the Polymer option has been activated by the [POLYMER](#__RefHeading___Toc38609_2267116897) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section. [PLYKRRF](#__RefHeading___Toc245845_501926209) should consist of an array of real positive values that are greater than or equal to one. See the PERMFAC parameter on the [PLYROCK](#__RefHeading___Toc110216_2939291539) keyword in the [PROPS](#__RefHeading___Toc39329_784232322) section for setting the property for the whole grid.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

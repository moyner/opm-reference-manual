### PLYKRRF – Define Polymer Rock Permeability Reduction by Cell


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The PLYKRRF keyword defines the polymer rock permeability reduction factor to the water phase by individual cell, for when the Polymer option has been activated by the POLYMER keyword in the RUNSPEC section. PLYKRRF should consist of an array of real positive values that are greater than or equal to one. See the PERMFAC parameter on the PLYROCK keyword in the PROPS section for setting the property for the whole grid.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

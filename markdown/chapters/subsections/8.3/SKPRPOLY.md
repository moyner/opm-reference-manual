#### Description

This keyword, [SKPRPOLY](#__RefHeading___Toc473331_21243525711), describes the relationship of a water injection well's injected polymer skin pressure as a function of polymer throughput and water velocity, for the simulator's Polymer Molecular Weight Transport option. The table is a two dimensional table that relates the polymer throughput values and water velocity values to derive the resulting wellbore skin pressure of the injected polymer, which is then used to calculate the total wellbore skin pressure based on the polymer concentration.

This keyword should only be used if the [POLYMER](#__RefHeading___Toc38609_2267116897) and [POLYMW](#__RefHeading___Toc38609_22671168971) keywords in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section are also activated.


| Note This is an OPM Flow specific keyword that employs an alternative polymer flood model based on a Polymer Molecular Weight Transport equation, that is not available in the commercial simulator. The model has been tested using metric units; however, using either field or laboratory units with the option should be considered experimental. |

| Field | Metric | Laboratory |  |
| 1-1 | SKPRPNUM | A positive integer value greater than zero and less than or equal to the NTSKPOLY variable, as defined on the [PINTDIMS](#__RefHeading___Toc637730_5168988431) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section, that defines the [SKPRPOLY](#__RefHeading___Toc473331_21243525711) Polymer Molecular Weight Model polymer injection skin pressure table number. | None |
| 1-2 | POLCON | A real positive value that the defines the reference polymer concentration  for the table. | None |
| lb/stb | kg/sm3 | gm/scc |  |
| 2-1 | THRUPUT | A real positive monotonically increasing vector, that defines the polymer throughput values.  The first entry should be zero to define a no throughput data set, and each vector record should be on a separate line terminated by a “/”. | None |
| feet3/feet2 | m3/m2 | cm3/cm2 |  |
| 3-1 | VELOCITY | A real positive monotonically increasing vector, that defines the polymer velocity values. The first entry should be zero to define a no velocity data set, and each vector record should be on a separate line terminated by a “/”. | None |
| feet/day | m/day | cm/hour |  |
| 4-1 | PRESS | A series of real positive vectors representing the wellbore skin pressure, for the given reference polymer concentration (POLCON), for all combinations of the polymer throughput values (THRUPUT) and velocity values (VELOCITY), organized as a series of vectors PRESS(THRUPUT, VELOCITY). Thus, the first vector represents the wellbore skin pressure of the first THRUPUT value and each entry in the vector is the corresponding wellbore skin pressure of the associated VELOCITY vector. Each vector should be on a separate line and should be terminated by a “/”. Thus, if THRUPUT has three entries and VELOCITY has four, then there should be three vectors, with each vector containing four elements representing wellbore skin pressure values, as a function of THRUPUT and VELOCITY. | None |

*Table 8.156: SKPRPOLY Keyword Description*


Unlike other [PROPS](#__RefHeading___Toc39329_784232322) section table keywords, that enable multiple tables following the keyword to be entered, the [SKPRPOLY](#__RefHeading___Toc473331_21243525711) keyword requires that the keyword itself must be repeated for each table, as is shown in the example on the following page.

The [WSKPTAB](#__RefHeading___Toc121649_241258616011) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section may be used to assign the [SKPRPOLY](#__RefHeading___Toc473331_21243525711) and [SKPRWAT](#__RefHeading___Toc473331_212435257111) tables to water injections wells, that enable the calculation of the wellbore skin pressure based on the fluids being injected.

See also the [SKPRWAT](#__RefHeading___Toc473331_212435257111), [PLYMWINJ](#__RefHeading___Toc473331_2124352571), and [PLYVMH](#__RefHeading___Toc473331_21243525712) keywords, in the [PROPS](#__RefHeading___Toc39329_784232322) section, that are the additional property keywords required for the Polymer Molecular Weight Transport option. In addition, see also the [WPMITAB](#__RefHeading___Toc121649_24125861601) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section, that assigns the [PLYMWINJ](#__RefHeading___Toc473331_2124352571) tables to the water injection wells.

Note that the standard polymer property data keywords: [PLYROCK](#__RefHeading___Toc110216_2939291539), [PLYADS](#__RefHeading___Toc121087_57619843), [PLYMAX](#__RefHeading___Toc110214_2939291539), etc., are still required to fully describe the polymer fluid.


#### Example

Given NTSKPOLY equals two on the [PINTDIMS](#__RefHeading___Toc637730_5168988431) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section,  then two [SKPRPOLY](#__RefHeading___Toc473331_21243525711) tables are required to be entered:

As mentioned previously, the [SKPRPOLY](#__RefHeading___Toc473331_21243525711) keyword requires that the keyword itself must be repeated for each table, as is shown in the above example.

### SURFROCK – Define Surfactant-Rock Properties


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The SURFROCK keyword defines rock properties for when the Surfactant option has been activated by the SURFACTANT keyword in the RUNSPEC section.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | :------ | --- |
| Field | Metric | Laboratory |  |
| 1 | ADINDX | A positive integer of 1 or 2 that defines the surfactant desorption option. | Defined |
| dimensionless 1 | dimensionless 1 | dimensionless 1 |  |
| 2 | DENSITY | A real value that defines the rock in-situ density, that is at reservoir conditions. | None |
| lb/rtb | kg/rm3 | gm/rcc |  |

#### Example


```
--
--       SURFACTANT-ROCK PROPERTIES
--
SURFROCK
--       DESORP   INSITU
--       OPTN     DENSITY
--       ------   -------
           1      1800.0                                   / TABLE NO. 01
           2      1980.0                                   / TABLE NO. 02
           1      2005.0                                   / TABLE NO. 03
```


The above example defines three surfactant-rock tables, based on the NTSFUN variable on the TABDIMS keyword in the RUNSPEC section being equal to three.

There is no terminating “/” for this keyword.

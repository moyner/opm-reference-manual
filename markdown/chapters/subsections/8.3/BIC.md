#### Description

The [BIC](#REF_HEADING_KEYWORD_BIC) keyword defines the binary interaction coefficients for each pair of compositional components active in the model and for each equation of state. The keyword should only be used if the compositional mode has been requested using the [COMPS](#__RefHeading___Toc27871_3671211675 Copy 1) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section.

OPM Flow does not currently support the general compositional modeling formulation.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but it will be parsed and its data ignored.

| 1 | [BIC](#REF_HEADING_KEYWORD_BIC) | A series of real numbers that define the binary interaction coefficients  for each pair (i, j) of compositional components active in the model. The matrix  is symmetrical with zeroes on the diagonal so only the portion of the matrix below the diagonal is required (i.e., i = {2, ... [COMPS](#__RefHeading___Toc27871_3671211675 Copy 1)} and j < i), where [COMPS](#__RefHeading___Toc27871_3671211675 Copy 1) is specified by the [COMPS](#__RefHeading___Toc27871_3671211675 Copy 1) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section. The values are ordered with j cycling fastest (i.e. , , , , , , ...). | 0 |

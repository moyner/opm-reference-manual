| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

This keyword defines the exponent used in Stone’s^[Stone, H. L. “Probability Model for Estimating Three-Phase Relative Permeability,” paper SPE 2116, Journal of Canadian Petroleum Technology (1973) 22, No. 2, 214-218.] first three phase oil relative permeability model as modified by Aziz and Settari^[Aziz, K. and Settari, A. Petroleum Reservoir Simulation, London, UK, Applied Science Publishers (1979), page 398.]. The STONE1EX keyword should only be used in three phase runs containing the oil, gas and water phases and when the STONE1 keyword in the PROPS section has been used to activate Stone’s first three phase oil relative permeability model.

*Table 8.180: STONE1EX Keyword Description*


If the STONE, STONE1 and STONE2 keywords are not present in the input deck then the default three phase oil relative permeability model is employed.


#### Example

Given NTSFUN equals five on the TABDIMS keyword in the RUNSPEC section, then:

```


Defines the exponents to be used in the Modified Stone first three phase oil relative permeability model, for each of the five saturation tables.

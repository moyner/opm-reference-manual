#### Description

The [HYSTCHCK](#__RefHeading___Toc468917_2135714711) keyword activate the hysteresis imbibition and drainage end-point check to validate that the two sets of end-points are consistent, for when the Hysteresis option has been activated by the HYSTER variable on the [SATOPTS](#__RefHeading___Toc37029_327352552) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section, and the [ENDSCALE](#__RefHeading___Toc68146_2267116897) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section has been activated to enable end-point scaling.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

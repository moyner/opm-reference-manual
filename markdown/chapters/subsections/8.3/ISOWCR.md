#### Description

ISOWCR defines the imbibition critical oil saturation for all the cells in the model via an array when the end-point scaling option has been invoked via the ENDSCALE in the RUNSPEC section and the hysteresis model option has been activated on the SATOPTS keyword in the RUNSPEC section. The critical oil saturation with respect to water is defined as the maximum oil saturation for which the oil relative permeability is zero in a two-phase oil-water relative permeability table.  The keyword can be used with all grid types.

| 1 | ISOWCR | ISOWCR is an array of real numbers assigning the critical oil saturation with respect to water values to each cell in the model. The number of entries should correspond to the NX x NY x NZ parameters on the DIMENS keyword. Repeat counts may be used, for example 30*0.30 | Taken from cell allocated relative permeability table. |

*Table 8.68: ISOWCR Keyword Description*


End-point scaling allows the entered relative permeability functions to be re-scaled based on the saturation end-points allocated to each cell by the ISWL, ISWCR, ISWU, ISGL, ISGCR, ISGU, ISOWCR, and ISOGCR  saturation grid arrays for the saturation end-points, and the IKRG, IKRORG, IKRORW and IKRW relative permeability grid cell arrays for the relative permeability end-point data. In addition end-point scaling may be directional dependent in which case the directional dependent versions of the aforementioned arrays should be used, that is ISOWCRX, ISOWCRY and ISOWCRZ instead of ISOWCR. There is also the facility to make the directional end-point scaling reversible or non-reversible and if the non-reversible option is selected the non-reversible versions of the aforementioned arrays should be used, that is ISOWCRX, ISOWCRX-, ISOWCRY, ISOWCRY-,  ISOWCRZ and ISOWCRZ-,  instead of the ISOWCR keyword.


#### Example


```
--
--       DEFINE GRID BLOCK END-POINT ISOWCR DATA FOR ALL CELLS
--       (NX x NY x NZ = 300)
--
ISOWCR
         300*0.200                                                              /

```

The above example defines a constant critical gas saturation of 0.20 to all 300 cells in the model as defined by the DIMENS keyword in the RUNSPEC section

### COAL – Activate the Coal Phase (CBM Model)


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The COAL keyword actives the coal phase and the Coal Bed Methane (“CBM”) model for the run.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

There is no data required for this keyword and there is no terminating “/” for this keyword.


#### Example


```
--
--       ACTIVATE THE COAL PHASE (CBM MODEL) IN THE MODEL
--
COAL

```

The above example declares that the Coal phase is active in the run and activates the CBM model option.

#### Description

The [ACTPARAM](#__RefHeading___Toc188116_2366741785) keyword defines the maximum target percent value for the [ACTION](#__RefHeading___Toc148342_63720426) series of keywords and the fractional equality tolerance for determining if two numbers are numerically equal when comparing values using the [ACTION](#__RefHeading___Toc148342_63720426) series of keywords. The [ACTION](#__RefHeading___Toc148342_63720426) keyword allows the user to enter computational logic and calculations to the simulation run based on the how the simulation run is proceeding.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | Metric | Laboratory |  |
| 1 | MXTOLS | A positive real value that defines the maximum target percent number for the [ACTION](#__RefHeading___Toc148342_63720426) series of keywords. The default value of 100 means the target is not applied. | Defined |
| percent 100.0 | percent 100.0 | percent 100.0 |  |
| 2 | MXEQLS | MXEQLS a real positive number greater than zero and less than one that defines the tolerance used to determine if two real values are equal for comparing values in the [ACTION](#__RefHeading___Toc148342_63720426) series of keywords. Floating-point numbers (as implemented in computers) are never exact, one cannot compare floating point numbers for exact equality.  Thus, MXEQLS defines a tolerance. For example, the default value of 1 x 10-4 means that if the difference between two real values is less than 1 x 10-4 then the values are considered equal. | Defined |
| fraction 1 x 10-4 | fraction 1 x 10-4 | fraction 1 x 10-4 |  |

*Table 5.4: ACTPARAM Keyword Description*


Although this keyword is read by OPM Flow, the [ACTION](#__RefHeading___Toc148342_63720426) and [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) computational logic and calculations have not been fully implemented and therefore this keyword should not be used as it may result in OPM Flow terminating.


#### Example


```
--
--       ACTION    ACTION
--       MXTOLS    MXEQLS
ACTPARAM
         5.0       1.0E-4                                                      /

```

The above example defines the maximum tolerance to be 5% and the equality tolerance to be the default value of 1.0 x 10-4.

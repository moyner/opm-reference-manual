#### Description

The [NRSOUT](#__RefHeading___Toc274544_718033703) keyword specifies the maximum number of elements that can be written to the [RESTART](#__RefHeading___Toc135629_1317547213) file at each reporting time step.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

#### Example


```
--
--       MAX
--       NRSOUT
NRSOUT
         6000                                                     /
```


The above example sets the maximum number of elements that can be written to the [RESTART](#__RefHeading___Toc135629_1317547213) file at each reporting time step to 6000.

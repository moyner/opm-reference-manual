This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

*Table 5.28: NRSOUT Keyword Description*


#### Example


```
--
--       MAX
--       NRSOUT
NRSOUT
         6000                                                     /
```


The above example sets the maximum number of elements that can be written to the RESTART file at each reporting time step to 6000.

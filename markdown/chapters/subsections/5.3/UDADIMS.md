#### Description

This keyword defines the dimensions of the User Defined Arguments (“UDA”) used by OPM Flow that can be applied to various connection, group, and well keywords in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section. UDAs are defined by the [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) keyword that is used to specify values to be constants, [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) variables, as defined in [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) section, or a formula using various mathematical functions together with constants and [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) variables.

Although this keyword is read by OPM Flow and the [ACTION](#__RefHeading___Toc148342_63720426) and [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) computational logic and calculations have been implemented, one should used caution using this facility as it may result in OPM Flow aborting.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | NMUDA | NMUDA is a positive integer that defines the number of arguments in a [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section keyword, that are replaced by numeric [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) values. | 0 |
| 2 | IGNORED | Not used and should be defaulted. | 1* |
| 3 | MXUDA | MXUDA is a positive integer that defines the maximum number of unique arguments in a keyword that are replaced by numeric UDA values. Note that MXUDA differs from NMUDA, for example: As MXUDA’s default value is 100 then this only needs to be increased  where the same UDA is used more than 100 times. | 100 |
| Notes: |  |  |  |

*Table 5.50: UDADIMS Keyword Description*


Note that OPM Flow has a more restricted [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) feature set than the commercial simulator, so not all options and functions are currently available.


#### Example


```
--
--       USER DEFINED ARGUMENT DIMENSIONS
--       NO.     NOT     TOTAL
--       ARGS    USED    UDQ
UDADIMS
         10       1*     10                                                    /
```


In the above example both NMUDA and MXUDA are set equal to ten.

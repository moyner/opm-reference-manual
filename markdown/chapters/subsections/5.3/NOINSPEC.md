#### Description

The [NOINSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc70892_4106839650) keyword deactivates the writing out of the INIT index file (*.INSPEC). The initialization data (or static data) is written out to two files one file contains the data, *.INIT, and the second file contains an index of the data (*.INSPEC) stored in the *.INIT file. This functionality is redundant as most post-processing software require the *.INSPEC file to load the *.INIT data set.

Hence, OPM Flow ignores this keyword. It is documented here for completeness.

There is no data required for this keyword and there is no terminating “/” for this keyword.


#### Example


```
--
--       DEACTIVATE OUTPUT OF THE INIT INDEX FILE *.INSPEC
--
NOINSPEC

```

The above example switches off the writing of the INIT index file (*.INSPEC); however, this has no effect in OPM Flow input decks.

#### Description

This keyword defines the dimensions associated with the [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) keyword used in OPM Flow to calculate various user defined values in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section.  The [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) keyword defined variables can be constants, [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) variables, as defined in the [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) section,  or a formula using various mathematical functions together with constants and [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) variables.

Although this keyword is read by OPM Flow and the [ACTION](#__RefHeading___Toc148342_63720426) and [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) computational logic and calculations have been implemented, one should used caution using this facility as it may result in OPM Flow aborting.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | MXFUNS | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of functions that can be included when defining a [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) definition. This should also include any brackets that will be used in the [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) definition. | 16 |
| 2 | MXITEMS | MXITEMS is a positive integer that defines the maximum number of ITEMS allowed in an [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) definition. | 16 |
| 3 | MXUDC | MXUDC is a positive integer that defines the maximum number of user defined CONNECTION quantities allowed in an [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) definition. | 0 |
| 4 | MXUDF | MXUDF is a positive integer that defines the maximum number of user defined [FIELD](#__RefHeading___Toc71850_2267116897) quantities allowed in an [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) definition. | 0 |
| 5 | MXUDG | MXUDG is a positive integer that defines the maximum number of user defined GROUP quantities allowed in an [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) definition. | 0 |
| 6 | MXUDR | MXUDR is a positive integer that defines the maximum number of user defined REGION quantities allowed in an [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) definition. | 0 |
| 7 | MXUDS | MXUDS is a positive integer that defines the maximum number of user defined SEGMENT quantities allowed in an [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) definition. | 0 |
| 8 | MXUDW | MXUDW is a positive integer that defines the maximum number of user defined WELL quantities allowed in an [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) definition. | 0 |
| 9 | MXUDA | MXUDA is a positive integer that defines the maximum number of user defined AQUIFER quantities allowed in an [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) definition. | 0 |
| 10 | MXUDB | MXUDB is a positive integer that defines the maximum number of user defined BLOCK quantities allowed in an [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) definition. | 0 |
| 11 | RSEED | RSEED is a character string that determines if a new random number seed should be generated for restart runs for use in the [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) functions RANDN, RANDU RRNDN and RRNDU.  If RSEED is set to Y than a new seed will be generated and if set to the default value of N or 1* then the same seed of the “base” simulation will be employed. See also the RSEED integer variable on the [UDQPARAM](#__RefHeading___Toc161093_2932703077) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section to set the random number seed for the current run. This feature is not supported by OPM Flow. | N |

*Table 5.51: UDQDIMS Keyword Description*


Note that OPM Flow has a more restricted [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) feature set than the commercial simulator, so not all options and functions are available.


#### Example


```
--
--       USER DEFINED ARGUMENT DIMENSIONS FACILITY
--       MAX     MAX     MAX    MAX    MAX    MAX   MAX   MAX   MAX  MAX    RAND
--       FUNCS   ITEMS   CONNS  FIELD  GROUP  REGS  SEGTM WELL  AQUF BLCKS  OPT
UDQDIMS
         50      25      0      50     50     0     0     0     0    0      N  /
```


In this case the maximum number of functions that can be included when defining a [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) definition is set to 50, maximum number of items allowed in an [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) definition is 25, the maximum number of user defined field quantities allowed in an [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) definition is 50, and the maximum number of user defined group quantities allowed in an [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) definition is also 50. All other parameters are defaulted including the RSEED  variable (the same seed of the “base” simulation will be employed).

#### Description

This keyword activates the Non-Newtonian Fluid phase and model for when the polymer phase is present in the model, as indicated by the [POLYMER](#__RefHeading___Toc38609_2267116897) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

| 1 | NTHRBL | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of Herschel-Bulkley versus polymer concentration tables to be used with the polymer model, as entered via the [FHERCHBL](#__RefHeading___Toc285530_803326780) keyword in the [PROPS](#__RefHeading___Toc39329_784232322) section. The tables are allocated to different parts of the grid by the [HBNUM](#__RefHeading___Toc290467_870710203) keyword in the [REGIONS](#__RefHeading___Toc40648_784232322) section | NTPVT |
| 2 | NLNHBL | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of rows for each table entered by the [FHERCHBL](#__RefHeading___Toc285530_803326780) keyword in the [PROPS](#__RefHeading___Toc39329_784232322) section. | 2 |

*Table 5.27: NNEWTF Keyword Description*


#### Example


```
--
--       MAX     MAX
--       NTHRBL  NLNHBL
NNEWTF
          3      5                                                             /
```


The above example defines maximum number of Herschel-Bulkley tables to be three with a maximum number of rows for each table set to five.

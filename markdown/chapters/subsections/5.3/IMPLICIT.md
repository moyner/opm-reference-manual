#### Description

The [IMPLICIT](#__RefHeading___Toc534216_2135714711) keyword activates the Fully Implicit Solution formulation and solution options. OPM Flow uses a different numerical scheme which makes this keyword redundant; hence, OPM Flow ignores this keyword. It is documented here for completeness. The keyword as the same function as the [FULLIMP](#__RefHeading___Toc51445_4106839650) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section.

There is no data required for this keyword and there is no terminating “/” for this keyword.

See section [2.2](#2.2.Running OPM Flow 2018-10 |outline)[ ](#2.2.Running OPM Flow 2018-10 |outline)[Running OPM Flow 2023-04 From The Command Line](#2.2.Running OPM Flow 2018-10 |outline) on how to invoke various numerical schemes via the OPM Flow command line interface.


#### Example


```
--
--       ACTIVATES THE FULLY IMPLICIT SOLUTION OPTION
--
IMPLICIT

```

The above example switches on the fully implicit solution option; however, this has no effect in OPM Flow input decks.

### IMPLICIT – Activate Fully Implicit Solution Option


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The IMPLICIT keyword activates the Fully Implicit Solution formulation and solution options. OPM Flow uses a different numerical scheme which makes this keyword redundant; hence, OPM Flow ignores this keyword. It is documented here for completeness. The keyword as the same function as the FULLIMP keyword in the RUNSPEC section.

There is no data required for this keyword and there is no terminating “/” for this keyword.

See section 2.2 Running OPM Flow 2023-04 From The Command Line on how to invoke various numerical schemes via the OPM Flow command line interface.


#### Example


```
--
--       ACTIVATES THE FULLY IMPLICIT SOLUTION OPTION
--
IMPLICIT

```

The above example switches on the fully implicit solution option; however, this has no effect in OPM Flow input decks.

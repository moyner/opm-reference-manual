#### Description

The DUALPERM keyword activates the Dual Permeability option and the Dual Porosity option for the run.  In a dual porosity system flow occurs between the matrix and the fracture only, whereas in a dual permeability system flow also occurs between the matrix grid blocks^[Warren, J.E. and Root, P.J. 1963.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

There is no data required for this keyword and there is no terminating “/” for this keyword.


#### Example


```
--
--       ACTIVATE DUAL PERMEABILITY MODEL
--
DUALPERM


```

The above example declares that the Dual Permeability option is active for the run.

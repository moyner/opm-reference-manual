### ECLMC – Activate Multi-Component Brine Model


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The ECLMC keyword activates the Multi-Component Brine model that allows for the water phase to have multiple water salinities. The keyword should be used in conjunction with the BRINE keyword in the RUNSPEC. Both keywords must be specified to activate the Multi-Component Brine model, whereas the BRINE keyword only is required to activate the standard brine tracking model.

There is no data required for this keyword and there is no terminating “/” for this keyword.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.


#### Example

The first example activates the standard Brine Tracking model.


```
--
--       ACTIVATE STANDARD BRINE MODEL
--
BRINE
```


The next example shows the ECLMC and BRINE keywords for when the Multi-Component Brine model is required.


```
--
--       ACTIVATE MULTI-COMPONENT BRINE MODEL
--
ECLMC
--
--       DEFINE WATER PHASE MULTI-COMPONENT BRINE COMPONENTS
--
--       SALT1   SALT2   SALT3   SALT4   SALT5
BRINE
         NACL    CACL2   MGC03                                                 /
```


The above example activates the Multi-Component Brine model with three different water salinities.

### NOMONITO – Deactivate Output of the Monitoring Data and File {#kw-NOMONITO}

#### Description

The NOMONITO keyword deactivates the writing out of the run time monitoring information used by post-processing graphics software to display run time information, for example the simulated production and injection rates and cumulative values. OPM Flow does not have this functionality.

Hence, OPM Flow ignores this keyword but it is documented here for completeness.

There is no data required for this keyword and there is no terminating “/” for this keyword.


#### Example


```
--
--       DEACTIVATE MONITORING OUTPUT DATA AND FILES
--
NOMONITO

```

The above example switches off the output required for run time monitoring required by post-processing graphics software to review the simulation results in real time as the run progresses; however, this has no effect in OPM Flow input decks.

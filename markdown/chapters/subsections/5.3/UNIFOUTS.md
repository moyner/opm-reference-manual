#### Description

The [UNIFOUTS](#__RefHeading___Toc1695476_4250154414) keyword causes the [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) file output files to be a unified file, as opposed to non-unified multiple files. A unified file is a single file containing output for each reporting time step. Here a single [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) file will be generated, as opposed to one file per report time step. See also the [MULTOUT](#__RefHeading___Toc195175_1371377330) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section that sets both the [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) and [RESTART](#__RefHeading___Toc135629_1317547213) files to be non-unified multiple files, as opposed to unified files. Note also that [UNIFOUTS](#__RefHeading___Toc1695476_4250154414) keyword has precedence over the [MULTOUT](#__RefHeading___Toc195175_1371377330) keyword for [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) files.


There is no data required for this keyword and there is no terminating “/” for this keyword.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but has no effect on the results so it will be ignored.


#### Example


```
--
--       ACTIVATE THE UNIFIED OUTPUT SUMMARY FILE OPTION
--
UNIFOUTS
```


The above example switches on writing of unified [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) output files.

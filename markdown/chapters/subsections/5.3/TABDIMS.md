### TABDIMS – Define the Number of Tables and the Table Dimensions


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The TABDIMS keyword defines the maximum number of tables for a given table type dataset and the maximum number of entries for the various tables.  The commercial simulator combines both the black-oil and compositional simulator variables on this keyword; however, although all the parameters are explained below only the black-oil parameters are used by OPM Flow.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | :------ | --- |
| 1 | NTSFUN | A positive integer that defines the number of relative permeability table sets defined in the input deck. The tables are allocated to different parts of the grid by the SATNUM keyword. | 1 |
| 2 | NTPVT | A positive integer that defines the number of fluid property table sets  defined in the input deck. The tables are allocated to different parts of the grid by the PVTNUM keyword. | 1 |
| 3 | NSSFUN | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of saturation entries in the relative permeability tables defined in the input deck. | 20 |
| 4 | NPPVT | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of pressure entries in the PVT tables. | 20 |
| 5 | NTFIP | A positive integer defining the maximum number of regions in the FIPNUM region array. Note that this parameter may also be set on the REGDIMS keyword as well. If NTFIP is set in both places then the maximum value is used. | 1 |
| 6 | NRPVT | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of Rs and Rv entries in the PVT tables. If the DISGAS and VAPOIL options have not been activated then this parameter is ignored. | 20 |
| 7 | NRVPVT | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of Rv entries in the PVT tables for the commercial compositional simulator. | 20 |
| 8 | NTENDP | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of saturation end-point depth tables. The end-point depth tables are used to re-scale the saturation tables as a function of depth as oppose to being a grid block property. NTENDP may also be specified on the ENDSCALE keyword,  and if specified on both here and on the ENDSCALE keyword the maximum value of the two is used. | 1 |
| 9 | NMEOSR | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of reservoir equations of states for the commercial compositional simulator. | 1 |
| 10 | NMEOSS | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of separator or surface equations of states for the commercial compositional simulator. | 1 |
| 11 | MXNFLX | A positive integer defining the maximum number flux regions in the FLUXNUM region array. MXNFLX can also be defined on the REGDIMS keywords as well.  If MXNFLX is defined both here and on the REGDIMS keyword then the maximum value of the two is used. | 10 |
| 12 | MXNTHR | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of thermal regions for the commercial compositional simulator. | 1 |
| 13 | NTROCC | A positive integer that defines the number of rock compressibility entries enter by the ROCK keyword defined in the input deck. The ROCK data is allocated to different parts of the grid by the either the PVTNUM or ROCKNUM keywords in the REGIONS section. If NTROCC is defaulted then the PVTNUM array will be used to allocate the ROCK keyword data to the grid blocks; whereas, if a value is entered then the ROCKNUM array will be used instead. See also the ROCKOPTS keyword in the PROPS section that can be used to redefine if the PVTNUM, ROCKNUM or SATNUM arrays should be employed to allocate the ROCK keyword data. | 1* |
| 14 | MXNPMR | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of pressure maintenance regions for the commercial compositional simulator. | 0 |
| 15 | NTABKT | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of temperature dependent K-value tables for the when the thermal option is activated in the commercial compositional simulator. | 0 |
| 16 | NTALPHA | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of transport coefficient tables for the commercial compositional simulator. | 0 |
| 17 | NASPKA | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of maximum number of entries in the ASPKDAM keyword tables for the commercial compositional simulator. | 10 |
| 18 | MXRAWG | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of maximum number of entries in the ASPREWG keyword tables for the commercial compositional simulator. | 10 |
| 19 | MXRASO | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of pressure maintenance regions for the commercial compositional simulator. | 10 |
| 20 |  | Not Used | 1* |
| 21 | MCASPP | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of column entries in the ASPPW2D keyword tables for the commercial compositional simulator. | 5 |
| 22 | MRASPP | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of row entries in the ASPPW2D keyword tables for the commercial compositional simulator. | 5 |
| 23 | MXRATF | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of entries in the ASPWETF table for the commercial compositional simulator. | 5 |
| 24 | MXNKVT | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of composition dependent K-value tables for the commercial compositional simulator. | 0 |

#### Example


```
--
--       NO.     NO.     MAX     MAX     MAX     MAX    E300
--       NTSFUN  NTPVT   NSSFUN  NPPVT   NTFIP   NRPVT  BLANK  NTEND
TABDIMS
         15      9       40      30      1*      1*     1*     1               /
```


The above example defines number of relative permeability tables to be 15 with a maximum number of rows for each table set to 40, and the number of PVT tables to be nine with a maximum number of 30 rows per table.

### NORSSPEC – Deactivate Output of the RESTART Index File {#kw-NORSSPEC}

#### Description

The NORSSPEC keyword deactivates the writing out of the [RESTART](#kw-RESTART) index file (*.[RSSPEC](#kw-RSSPEC)). The restart data (pressure, saturations etc. through time for each active cell) are written out to two files one file contains the data, *.UNRST for example, and the second file contains an index of the data (*.[RSSPEC](#kw-RSSPEC)) stored in the *.UNRST file. This functionality is redundant as most post-processing software require the *.[RSSPEC](#kw-RSSPEC) file to load the *.UNRST data set.

Hence, OPM Flow ignores this keyword. It is documented here for completeness.

There is no data required for this keyword and there is no terminating “/” for this keyword.


#### Example


```
--
--       DEACTIVATE OUTPUT OF THE RESTART INDEX FILE *.RSSPEC
--
NORSSPEC

```

The above example switches off the writing of the restart index file (*.[RSSPEC](#kw-RSSPEC)); however, this has no effect in OPM Flow input decks.

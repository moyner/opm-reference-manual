#### Description

The [NORSSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc79044_4106839650) keyword deactivates the writing out of the [RESTART](#__RefHeading___Toc135629_1317547213) index file (*.RSSPEC). The restart data (pressure, saturations etc. through time for each active cell) are written out to two files one file contains the data, *.UNRST for example, and the second file contains an index of the data (*.RSSPEC) stored in the *.UNRST file. This functionality is redundant as most post-processing software require the *.RSSPEC file to load the *.UNRST data set.

Hence, OPM Flow ignores this keyword. It is documented here for completeness.

There is no data required for this keyword and there is no terminating “/” for this keyword.


#### Example


```
--
--       DEACTIVATE OUTPUT OF THE RESTART INDEX FILE *.RSSPEC
--
NORSSPEC

```

The above example switches off the writing of the restart index file (*.RSSPEC); however, this has no effect in OPM Flow input decks.

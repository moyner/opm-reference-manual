| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

This keyword switches on the LABORATORY system of units for the model.

OPM Flow has three sets of units, namely: METRIC, FIELD and LAB and one of these keyword should be invoked in the RUNSPEC section to avoid any ambiguity. Both the simulator input and output units are controlled by including one of the METRIC, FIELD or LAB keywords in the RUNSPEC section of the input file.

There is no data required for this keyword and there is no terminating “/” for this keyword.


#### Example


```
--
--       SWITCH ON THE LABORATORY SYSTEM OF UNITS FOR BOTH INPUT AND OUTPUT
--
LAB

```

The above example switches on the LABORATORY system of units for the model.

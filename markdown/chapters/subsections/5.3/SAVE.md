### SAVE – Activate Output of a SAVE File for Fast Restarts


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

This keyword activates output of a SAVE file for fast restarts which are read in by the LOAD keyword in the RUNSPEC section. No data is required for this keyword.

OPM Flow does not support the SAVE file format for fast restarts like the commercial simulator, but instead writes a standard RESTART file at the requested time step in the SCHEDULE section, which can then be used to restart the simulation at a given point in time via the RESTART keyword in the RUNSPEC section.


#### Example

The first example requests that a SAVE file be written out in the RUNSPEC section; however, OPM Flow will not write a RESTART record if the SAVE keyword is encountered in the RUNSPEC section.


```
-- ==============================================================================
--
-- RUNSPEC SECTION
--
-- ==============================================================================
RUNSPEC
--
--       WRITE OUT SAVE FILE FOR FAST RESTARTS
--
SAVE
```


The second example shows how the keyword is used in the SCHEDULE section.


```
-- ==============================================================================
--
-- SCHEDULE SECTION
--
-- ==============================================================================
SCHEDULE

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- SCHEDULE SECTION - 2020-01-01
-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          'WELLS=2'    'WELSPECS'    'CPU=2'     FIP=2'                         /

```


```

          1  JLY   2021  /

```

Here OPM Flow will write out a RESTART file instead of a SAVE file at April 1st, 2021.

### NOCASC – Activate Linear Solver Tracer Algorithm


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |

#### Description

NOCASC keyword activates the linear solver tracer algorithm for single phase tracers.

OPM Flow uses a different numerical scheme which makes this keyword redundant; hence, OPM Flow  ignores this keyword. It is documented here for completeness.

There is no data required for this keyword and there is no terminating “/” for this keyword.


#### Example


```
--
--       TRACER SOLVER OPTION
--
NOCASC

```

The above example switches on the linear solver tracer algorithm; however, this has no effect in OPM Flow input decks.

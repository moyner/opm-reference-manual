#### Description

The WSEGSDIMS keyword defines the multi-segment well dimensions for the multi-segment well model and the keyword is obligatory if multi-segment wells are being employed in the model.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | MXWELS | A positive integer defining the maximum number of multi-segment wells for this model. | 0 |
| 2 | MXSEGS | A positive integer defining the maximum number of segments per well for this model. | 1 |
| 3 | MXBRAN | A positive integer defining the maximum number of branches per multi-segment well, including the main branch groups for this model. | 1 |
| 4 | MXLINKS | A positive integer defining the maximum number of segment links per multi-segment well. The simulator does not currently support multi-segment chord links, and therefore this parameter is ignored. | 0 |

#### Example


```
--
--       WELL    WELL    BRANCH  SEGMENT
--       MXWELS  MXSEGS  MXBRAN  MXLINKS
WSEGDIMS
         5       100     10      10                                            /
```


The above example defines the maximum number of multi-segment wells to be five with up to 100 segments per multi-segment well, a maximum number of 10 branches per multi-segment well, and up to 10 segment links per multi-segment well.

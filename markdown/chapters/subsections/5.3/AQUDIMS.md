#### Description

The AQUDIMS keyword defines the dimensions of the various aquifer property data. The data is normally entered on a single line and is terminated by a “/”.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | :------ | --- |
| 1 | MXNAQN | A positive integer value that defines the [AQUNUM](#kw-AQUNUM) keyword maximum number of lines associated with this keyword, that is the maximum number of numerical aquifers | 1 |
| 2 | MXNAQC | A positive integer value that defines the [AQUCON](#kw-AQUCON) keyword maximum number of lines of connection data associated with this keyword, that is the maximum number of lines of connection data for numerical aquifers. | 1 |
| 3 | NIFTBL | A positive integer value that defines the [AQUTAB](#kw-AQUTAB) keyword maximum number of Carter-Tracy aquifer tables associated with this keyword. | 1 |
| 4 | NRIFTB | A positive integer value that defines the [AQUTAB](#kw-AQUTAB) keyword maximum number of rows in the Carter-Tracy aquifer tables associated with this keyword. NRIFTB must not be less than 36 in order to accommodate the default infinite acting Carter-Tracy aquifer influence function. | 36 |
| 5 | NANAQ | A positive integer value that defines the [AQUFETP](#kw-AQUFETP), [AQUFLUX](#kw-AQUFLUX) and [AQUCT](#kw-AQUCT) maximum number of analytical aquifers defined by these three keywords. | 1 |
| 6 | NCAMAX | A positive integer value that defines the maximum number of cells connected to an analytical aquifer. | 1 |
| 7 | MXNALI | A positive integer value that defines the maximum number of aquifer lists. | 0 |
| 8 | MXAAQL | A positive integer value that defines the maximum number of analytical aquifers in any single aquifer list as defined by (7). | 0 |

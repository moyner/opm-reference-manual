#### Description

This keyword switches on gravity drainage and imbibition modeling between the matrix and the fracture grid blocks in dual porosity and dual permeability runs.  Note that either [DZMTRX](#__RefHeading___Toc267162_1772380413) or [DZMTRXV](#__RefHeading___Toc267164_1772380413) keywords in the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) section should be used to set the matrix vertical dimensions if this option is activated.

There is no data required for this keyword and there is no terminating “/” for this keyword.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.


#### Example


```
--
--       ACTIVATE GRAVITY DRAINAGE AND IMBIBITION FOR DUAL POROSITY MODEL
--
GRAVDR

```

The above example switches on the gravity drainage and imbibition option for the run.

#### Description

Turns on the Constrained Pressure Residual (“CPR”) [Wallis, J. R., Little, T. E., and Nolen, J. S.: "Constrained Residual Acceleration of Conjugate Residual Methods," paper SPE 13536 presented at the SPE Reservoir Simulation Symposium, Dallas, Texas, USA (February 10-13, 1985).],  [R.

The keyword is equivalent to using the OPM Flow command line parameter  --linear-solver= “cprw”. Note that if the command line has been used, then this will take precedence over the CPR keyword.

#### Example


```
--
--       ACTIVATE CONSTRAINED PRESSURE RESIDUAL LINEAR SOLVER FOR THE RUN
--
CPR
/

```

The above example activates the Constrained Pressure Residual preconditioner linear solver using the default option, that is the ORIGINAL option for OPM Flow.

To enable the CPR preconditioner linear solver option using the command line parameter, use:


```
flow --linear-solver="cpr" CASENAME.DATA
```


which should usually be combined with the -matrix-add-well-contributions=true option, that is:


```
flow --linear-solver=cpr --matrix-add-well-contributions=true CASENAME.DATA
```


However, the new CPRW preconditioner, that includes wells does not need the latter option, so in this instance use:


```
flow --linear-solver=cprw CASENAME.DATA

```


As of this release the CPRW preconditioner,  should be considered experimental, and the recommended  configuration for running this is:


```
flow --linear-solver=cprw --linear-solver-reduction=0.005 --cpr-reuse-setup=4
     --cpr-reuse-interval=10 CASENAME.DATA
```

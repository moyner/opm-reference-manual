| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

VFPPDIMS keyword defines the maximum dimensions of the production well Vertical Lift Performance (“VFP”) tables defined by VFPPROD keyword. The VFP tables for the injection wells are defined by the VFPIDIMS keyword.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | MXMFLO | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of production flow rate entries for the VFPPROD keyword. | 0 |
| 2 | MXMTHP | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of THP entries for the VFPPROD keyword. | 0 |
| 3 | MXMWFR | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of water fraction entries (WOR, WCUT, GWR etc.) for the VFPPROD keyword. | 0 |
| 4 | MXMGFR | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of gas fraction entries (GOR, GLR, OGR etc.) for the VFPPROD keyword. | 0 |
| 5 | MXMALQ | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of artificial lift quantity entries for the VFPPROD keyword. | 0 |
| 6 | MXVFPTAB | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of VFPPROD tables entered through the VFPPROD keyword. | 0 |

#### Example


```
--       PRODUCING VFP TABLES
--       VFP     VFP     VFP     VFP     VFP     VFP
--       MXMFLO  MXMTHP  MXMWFR  MXMGFR  MXMALQ  NMMVFT
VFPPDIMS
         20      10      10      10      6       9                             /
```


Here the example shows that there are a maximum of 20 flow rates, 10 THP entries, 10 water and gas fraction entries, and six artificial lift entries for the nine VFPPROD VFP production tables.

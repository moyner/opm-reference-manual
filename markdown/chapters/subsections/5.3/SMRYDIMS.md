### SMRYDIMS – Define Maximum Number of Summary Vectors to be Written


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The SMRYDIMS keyword defines the maximum number of summary vectors to be written out to the SUMMARY file (*.SUMMARY).

OPM Flow uses dynamic memory allocation and therefore the keyword has no effect and is ignored by the simulator, but is documented here for completeness.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |

| 1 | NSUMMX | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of summary vectors to be written out to the SUMMARY file (*.SUMMARY). | 10000 |
| Notes: |  |  |  |

*Table 5.42: SMRYDIMS Keyword Description*


#### Example


```
--
--       SET THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SUMMARY VECTORS THAT CAN BE WRITTEN OUT
--
SMRYDIMS
         10000                                                                 /
```


The above example sets maximum number of summary vectors that can be written out to the SUMMARY file to the default value of 10,000; however, this has no effect in OPM Flow input decks.

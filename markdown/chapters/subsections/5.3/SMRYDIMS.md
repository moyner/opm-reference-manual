#### Description

The [SMRYDIMS](#__RefHeading___Toc61766_1778172979) keyword defines the maximum number of summary vectors to be written out to the [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) file (*.SUMMARY).

OPM Flow uses dynamic memory allocation and therefore the keyword has no effect and is ignored by the simulator, but is documented here for completeness.

| 1 | NSUMMX | A positive integer that defines the maximum number of summary vectors to be written out to the [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) file (*.SUMMARY). | 10000 |

*Table 5.42: SMRYDIMS Keyword Description*


#### Example


```
--
--       SET THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SUMMARY VECTORS THAT CAN BE WRITTEN OUT
--
SMRYDIMS
         10000                                                                 /
```


The above example sets maximum number of summary vectors that can be written out to the [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) file to the default value of 10,000; however, this has no effect in OPM Flow input decks.

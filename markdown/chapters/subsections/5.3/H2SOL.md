#### Description

The [H2SOL](#REF_HEADING_KEYWORD_H2SOL) keyword activates dissolved hydrogen (H2) in the water phase, where H2 is represented by the SOLVENT pseudo component, using the simulator’s H2-Brine PVT model. This keyword is a compositional keyword in the commercial simulator but has been implemented in OPM Flow’s black-oil model.

The [H2SOL](#REF_HEADING_KEYWORD_H2SOL) keyword can be used when modelling H2 injection in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs. See also the [H2STORE](#REF_HEADING_KEYWORD_H2STORE) keyword in the RUNSPEC section which can be used when modelling H2 injection in saline aquifers.

The H2-Brine PVT model computes the PVT properties such as density, viscosity, and enthalpy internally as functions of pressure, temperature, and composition by using analytic correlations and models from the literature rather than by interpolation of tabulated values in the input deck. These values are transformed to the standard black-oil equivalent PVT tables internally by the simulator. Dissolved hydrogen in brine is modeled using Li et al.^[Dedong Li, Christof Beyer, Sebastian Bauer, A unified phase equilibrium model for hydrogen solubility and solution density, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, Volume 43, Issue 1, 2018, Pages 512-529.]. Hydrogen gas density was modeled using Leachman et al.^[J. W. Leachman, R. T Jacobsen, S. G. Penoncello, E. W. Lemmon; Fundamental Equations of State for Parahydrogen, Normal Hydrogen, and Orthohydrogen. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 1 September 2009; 38 (3): 721–748.]. Other properties are modeled the same way as in CO2STORE but modified for hydrogen-brine (a similar approach was recently reported by Raad et al.^[Seyed Mostafa Jafari Raad, Ehsan Ranjbar, Hassan Hassanzadeh, Yuri Leonenko, Hydrogen-brine mixture PVT data for reservoir simulation of hydrogen storage in deep saline aquifers, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, Volume 48, Issue 2, 2023, Pages 696-708.]). A full description of the underlying PVT models used by CO2STORE is described by Sandve et al.^[Tor Harald Sandve, Sarah E. Gasda, Atgeirr Rasmussen, and Alf Birger Rustad. Convective dissolution in field scale CO2 storage simulation using the OPM Flow simulator. Submitted to TCCS 11 – Trondheim Conference on CO2 Capture, Transport and Storage Trondheim, Norway – June 21-23, 2021.]. Note that the H2-Brine PVT properties depend on the temperature and salinity and these must therefore be entered in the PROPS section. The reservoir temperature can be defined using, e.g., the RTEMP keyword. Region based salinity can be provided using the SALINITY keyword.

The [H2SOL](#REF_HEADING_KEYWORD_H2SOL) keyword must be used together with the SOLVENT keyword in the RUNSPEC section. The SOLVENT keyword activates the four component black-oil model: oil, water and gas, plus a solvent (in this case H2).

The DISGASW keyword in the RUNSPEC section can be used to model dissolution of H2 in the Brine. Note that hydrocarbon gas is not allowed to dissolve in the Brine (this is considered a reasonable assumption for most hydrocarbon gases).

The hydrocarbon reservoir fluid properties should be set up as normal apart from the water PVT properties, which will be defined by the simulators’ H2-Brine PVT model, so the water PVT keywords (e.g. PVTW) are not required. The H2 PVT properties will also be defined by the H2-Brine PVT model so the solvent PVT keywords (e.g. SDENSITY, PVTSOL) are also not required.

The oil-water and gas-water saturation functions should be set up as normal. The H2 and gas miscible relative permeability tables should be defined using the SSFN keyword in the PROPS section.

The initial H2 saturations in the model can be specified by enumeration using the SSOL keyword in the SOLUTION section.

The H2 fraction in a well’s injection stream can be defined using the WSOLVENT keyword in the SCHEDULE section.

There is no data required for this keyword and there is no terminating “/” for this keyword.


#### Example

The example shows the usage of [H2SOL](#REF_HEADING_KEYWORD_H2SOL) to model H2 injection in a live-oil reservoir. The RUNSPEC section includes the [H2SOL](#REF_HEADING_KEYWORD_H2SOL) keyword, which activates dissolved hydrogen (H2) in the water phase. The SOLVENT keyword activates the solvent pseudo component, which represents H2. The DISGASW keyword has been used to activate dissolved H2 in the brine.

The second part of the example covers the additional data required in the PROPS section, in which the H2-gas miscible relative permeabilities are defined using the SSFN keyword. The initial temperature and salinity are defined using the RTEMP and SALINITY keywords. The oil and gas PVT properties should be defined in the normal way. No water PVT data is required.

The third part of the example covers initialising the model in the SOLUTION section. Here the EQUIL keyword is used as normal to equilibrate the oil, gas and water phases, and the SSOL keyword to specify that there is initially no H2 present in the gas phase.

For the summary section, the H2 storage quantity can be tracked using the solvent injection and production volumes as shown below.

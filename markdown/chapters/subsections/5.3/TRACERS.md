#### Description

The [TRACERS](#__RefHeading___Toc76509_327352552) keyword defines the number of tracers in the model and the various passive tracer tracking options.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | MXOILTR | A positive integer defining the maximum number of passive oil tracers defined using the [TRACER](#__RefHeading___Toc121485_83452205) keyword. | 0 |
| 2 | MXWATTR | A positive integer defining the maximum number of passive water tracers defined using the [TRACER](#__RefHeading___Toc121485_83452205) keyword. | 0 |
| 3 | MXGASTR | A positive integer defining the maximum number of passive gas tracers defined using the [TRACER](#__RefHeading___Toc121485_83452205) keyword. | 0 |
| 4 | MXENVTR | A positive integer defining the maximum number of passive environmental tracers defined using the [TRACER](#__RefHeading___Toc121485_83452205) keyword.  Environmental tracers are used with the Environment Tracer model that takes into account tracer adsorption and decay. Only the default value of zero is currently supported. | 0 |
| 5 | DIFFOPT | A character string defining the numerical diffusion option for tracer tracking runs that should be set to: Only the default value of NODIFF is supported | NODIFF |
| 6 | MXITRTR | A positive integer defining the maximum number of non-linear iterations to be used when the tracer option is activated. | 12 |
| 7 | MNITRTR | A positive integer defining the minimum number of non-linear iterations to be used when the tracer option is activated. | 1 |
| 8 | NONLIN | A character string stating if passive tracers as should be linear (NO) or non-linear (YES). Only the default value of NO is supported. | No |
| 9 | LNCONFAC | A real value defining the initial linear convergence factor. The default value of 1* means the parameter will not be utilized. | 1* |
| 10 | NLCONFAC | A real value defining the initial non-linear convergence factor. The default value of 1* means the parameter will not be utilized. | 1* |
| 11 | CONFAC | A real value defining the LNCONFAC and NLCONFAC convergence factors to be used after the initial convergence factor has been applied. | 1.0 |
| 12 | NUMCONF | A positive integer defining the maximum number of times CONFAC can be used. | 0 |

See also the [TRACER](#__RefHeading___Toc121485_83452205) keyword in the [PROPS](#__RefHeading___Toc39329_784232322) section that defines the individual tracers.


#### Example


```
--
--       NO OIL  NO WAT  NO GAS  NO ENV  DIFF    MAX    MIN    TRACER
--       TRACERS TRACERS TRACERS TRACERS CONTL   NONLIN NONLIN NONLIN
TRACERS
         0       7       1       0      'NODIFF' 1*     1*     1*              /
```


The above example defines seven tracers in the water phase and one tracer in the gas phase.

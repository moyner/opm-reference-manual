#### Description

[BRANPROP](#__RefHeading___Toc162078_289573908) defines network branch properties for the extended network option for when the Extended Network Model has been activated by the [NETWORK](#__RefHeading___Toc311583_1841740821) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section. There are two types of network facilities in the simulator, the Standard Network model, which is defined with the [GRUPNET](#__RefHeading___Toc118319_1596574740) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section and the Extended Network Model defined by the [BRANPROP](#__RefHeading___Toc162078_289573908) and [NODEPROP](#__RefHeading___Toc212708_2026549522) keywords, again in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section.

For the Extended Network Model the group hierarchy can be different to that defined by the [GRUPTREE](#__RefHeading___Toc118321_1596574740) keyword; however, the bottom most nodes in the network tree associated with wells, must be the same as that defined by the [GRUPTREE](#__RefHeading___Toc118321_1596574740) keyword.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | Metric | Laboratory |  |
| 1 | DOWNNODE | A character string of up to eight characters in length that defines the  down stream node name for this branch, that is the node closest to the wells. Thus for a production network,  this will be an inlet node as the wells are importing fluid into the branch node. Whereas for an injection node, this is an outlet node as injection fluid is being exported to the wells. | None |
| 2 | UPNODE | A character string of up to eight characters in length that defines the up stream node name for this branch, that is the node furthermost from the wells. Thus for a production network,  this will be an outlet node as the wells are exporting fluid from the branch node. Whereas for an injection node, this is an inlet node as the wells are importing the injection fluid. | None |
| 3 | VFPTAB | A positive integer greater than or equal to zero that defines the vertical lift performance table to be used for calculating the pressure behavior  between the inlet (for production) or outlet (for injection) node (DOWNNODE) and the outlet (for production) or inlet (for injection) node (UPNODE). For a production network this must reference a table associated with the [VFPPROD](#__RefHeading___Toc121919_2556401936) keyword, and for an injection network a table declared via the [VFPINJ](#__RefHeading___Toc121917_2556401936) keyword. Both keywords are in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section. If the pressure behavior between the two nodes is zero (no pressure loss in the network branch), then a value of 9999 should be entered for this variable. A value of zero for VFPTAB removes the branch from the extended network and the resulting flows are ignored in the network flow stream. | None |
| 4 | ALQ-NODE | A real positive value that defines the artificial lift quantity to be used in conjunction with the [VFPPROD](#__RefHeading___Toc121919_2556401936) assigned to the branch via the VPFTAB variable. VFPTAB vertical lift performance table and the artificial lift quantity ALQ-NODE are used with the branch fluid rates to calculate the pressure  behavior through the branch. For a network this can be considered to be either a pump to pump fluid through the network or a compressor to compress gas to a higher export pressure. Basically, ALQ-NODE is used to reduce the pressure loss through the branch. Note that the units for ALQ-NODE are dependent on the associated variable on the [VFPPROD](#__RefHeading___Toc121919_2556401936) keyword. Should be set to zero if ALQ-DEN is set to either DENO or DENG, or if the branch is associated with an automatic compressor. | 0.0 |
| 5 | ALQ-DEN | A defined character string that defines that ALQ-NODE variable represents either as a surface density or as an artificial lift quantity for a pump or a compressor, and should be set to one of the following: The [VFPPROD](#__RefHeading___Toc121919_2556401936) keyword should be consistent with this variable, that is, if ALQ-DEN is set to to DENO then the surface oil should be used as the ALQ variable on the [VFPPROD](#__RefHeading___Toc121919_2556401936) keyword. | NONE |

#### Example

Given the following Extended Network model in Figure 12.3.

![Frame66](images/Frame66_c40b193fe195.png)
![Image60](images/Image60_c40b193fe195.png)

First the Extended Network model should be used invoked in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section, and then the [BRANPROP](#__RefHeading___Toc162078_289573908) keyword should be used to define the branch network, and finally the [NODEPROP](#__RefHeading___Toc212708_2026549522) keyword is used to describe the node properties.

Here the main platform for the field, PLAT-A, has a fixed 21 barsa pressure applied as an operating constraint.

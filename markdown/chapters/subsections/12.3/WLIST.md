#### Description

WLIST declares a group of wells to belong to a named static well list.  Wells in a named well list are treated as a group of wells for which the standard well keywords can be applied.  For example, instead of repeating a well keyword for each well, the keyword only needs to have the named well list instead, for the action to be applied to all wells in the named well list. In general any well keyword that allows well name roots as a well name, for example, PROD*,  can use a named well list.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | :------ | --- |
| 1 | WLIST | A character string of up to eight characters in length, enclosed in quotes, that defines the well list name for the WELNAMES declared by this record. Note the first character must be asterisk (“*”) and the second character must be a letter, for example, *PROD. | None |
| 2 | [ACTION](#kw-ACTION) | A defined character string that determines how the WELNAMES should be handled with respect to the named well list (WLIST).  [ACTION](#kw-ACTION) should be set to one of the following:: |  |
| 3-52 | WELNAMES | A character string of up to eight characters in length that defines the well name that belongs to the named well list (WLIST). A total of 50 well names can be added to WLIST at a time. If additional wells are needed to added then use the [ADD](#kw-ADD) option of [ACTION](#kw-ACTION) to add additional wells. Well names roots may all be used in WELNAMES as long as they are enclosed in quotes and end with an asterisk (“*”). In this case all wells that match the specification will be added to the list. For example, wells named OP01, OP02 and OP03, can be added as group by using “OP*” as the well name. Note that the well names must have been declared previously using the [WELSPECS](#kw-WELSPECS) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#kw-SCHEDULE) section, otherwise an error may occur |  |

: WLIST Keyword Description {#tbl-12-104}
Note that named well list production data in the [SUMMARY](#kw-SUMMARY) file is well dependent, that is, if the wells belonging to a named well list is changed through time, the [SUMMARY](#kw-SUMMARY) data will be based on the wells in the named well list group at the end of the run. Thus, if there are three wells in a named well list called *PROD1 at the beginning of a run; OP01, OP02 and OP03, and during the run OP03 is moved to a well named list called *PROD2, then the [SUMMARY](#kw-SUMMARY) data for *PROD1will only contain the production data for wells OP01 and OP02 and *PROD2 will only contain the [SUMMARY](#kw-SUMMARY) data for OP03 from the start to the end of the run.


#### Example

The following example defines two named well lists using the WLIST keyword.

In this example the wells in named well list ‘’*BLK-1” are opened on January 1, 2020 and wells in named well list ’*BLK-2” are opened October 1, 2021.

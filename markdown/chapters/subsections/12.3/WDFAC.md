#### Description

The [WDFAC](#__RefHeading___Toc442057_2026549522) keyword defines a gas well’s D-factor (flow dependent skin factor), which is normally derived from well tests or calculated analytically based on the coefficient of inertial resistance, usually known as β, in Forchheimer’s flow equation, [Geertsma, J., 1974. Estimating the Coefficient of Inertial Resistance in Fluid Flow Through Porous Media. Soc.Pet.Eng.J., October: 445-450.],  [Gewers, C.W.W. and Nichol, L.R., 1969. Gas Turbulence Factor in a Microvugular Carbonate. J.Can.Pet.Tech., April.] and  [Wong, S.W., 1970. Effects of Liquid Saturation on Turbulence Factors for Gas Liquid Systems. J.Can.Pet.Tech., October].

Internally the simulator evaluates a D-factor for each well connection by assuming the D-factors are inversely proportional to the connection transmissibility factors. This is done at the time the well D-factor is specified. If a connection is later closed then the well D-factor is likely to change but the connection D-factors for each of the remaining open connections should not be affected.

| 1 | WELNAME | A character string of up to eight characters in length that defines the well name for which the well D-factor is being defined. Note that the well name (WELNAME) must have been declared previously using the [WELSPECS](#__RefHeading___Toc268463_1366622701) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section. | None |
| 2 | DFACTOR | A real positive value greater than or equal to zero that defines the D-factor for the well. | 0.0 |

See also the [WDFACCOR](#__RefHeading___Toc48144_327352552) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section that uses Dake’s [Dake, L.P. Fundamentals of Reservoir Engineering, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Elsevier Science BV (1978)  Chapter 8.6, pages 252-257.] correlation to calculate the well D-factor; and the [COMPDAT](#__RefHeading___Toc97651_3261743917) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section that can be used to specify the connection D-factors directly.


#### Example


```

--
-- WELL  D-
-- NAME  FACTOR

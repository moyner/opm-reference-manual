#### Description

The WDFAC keyword defines a gas well’s D-factor (flow dependent skin factor), which is normally derived from well tests or calculated analytically based on the coefficient of inertial resistance, usually known as β, in Forchheimer’s flow equation,^[Geertsma, J., 1974. Estimating the Coefficient of Inertial Resistance in Fluid Flow Through Porous Media. Soc.Pet.Eng.J., October: 445-450.], ^[Gewers, C.W.W. and Nichol, L.R., 1969. Gas Turbulence Factor in a Microvugular Carbonate. J.Can.Pet.Tech., April.] and ^[Wong, S.W., 1970. Effects of Liquid Saturation on Turbulence Factors for Gas Liquid Systems. J.Can.Pet.Tech., October].

Internally the simulator evaluates a D-factor for each well connection by assuming the D-factors are inversely proportional to the connection transmissibility factors. This is done at the time the well D-factor is specified. If a connection is later closed then the well D-factor is likely to change but the connection D-factors for each of the remaining open connections should not be affected.

See also the WDFACCOR keyword in the SCHEDULE section that uses Dake’s^[Dake, L.P. Fundamentals of Reservoir Engineering, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Elsevier Science BV (1978)  Chapter 8.6, pages 252-257.] correlation to calculate the well D-factor; and the COMPDAT keyword in the SCHEDULE section that can be used to specify the connection D-factors directly.


#### Example


```
--
--       WELL D-FACTORS
--
-- WELL  D-
-- NAME  FACTOR
WEFAC
  GP01   1.0E-03 /
/

```

In the above example a well D-factor of 10-3 is specified for gas well GP01.

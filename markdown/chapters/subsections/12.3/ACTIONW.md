#### Description

This keyword starts the definition of an [ACTIONW](#__RefHeading___Toc152225_2992482751) section that stipulates the Boolean conditions to test the nominated well parameters, and the resulting [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) keywords to be executed, if the Boolean condition evaluates to true.  An [ACTIONW](#__RefHeading___Toc152225_2992482751) Definition Section is terminated by an [ENDACTIO](#__RefHeading___Toc109407_332691817) keyword on a separate line.  Here, the keyword defines a series of conditions applied to wells only, that invoke run time processing of [ACTION](#__RefHeading___Toc148342_63720426) functions, and is similar to executing a run time script for conditions and variables at the well level.  The [ACTION](#__RefHeading___Toc148342_63720426) series of keywords ([ACTION](#__RefHeading___Toc148342_63720426), [ACTIONG](#__RefHeading___Toc152219_2992482751), [ACTIONR](#__RefHeading___Toc152221_2992482751), [ACTIONS](#__RefHeading___Toc152223_2992482751) and [ACTIONW](#__RefHeading___Toc152225_2992482751)) can apply Boolean conditional tests to variables at the field, group, region, well segment and well levels.

Note that one should use caution when using this facility as it may result in the simulator aborting, because the [ACTIONW](#__RefHeading___Toc152225_2992482751) keyword enables the user to implement complex functionality and therefore it is advisable to start with simple expressions before adding the desired complexity.

See also the [PYACTION](#__RefHeading___Toc393199_4211536922) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) that implements OPM Flow’s Python scripting facility using the Python scripting language.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped; use the [ACTIONX](#__RefHeading___Toc152227_2992482751) keyword instead.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [ACTIONW](#__RefHeading___Toc152225_2992482751) | Defines the start of an [ACTIONW](#__RefHeading___Toc152225_2992482751) Definition Section.  This is followed on a new line by the [ACTIONW](#__RefHeading___Toc152225_2992482751) record that stipulates the conditions for which the defined action will be executed, and then this is followed by the various operations to be performed if the condition is satisfied. |  |  |
| 1-1 | ACTNAME | A character sting of up to eight characters in length that defines the name of this action definition. If ACTNAME has previously been used by any [ACTION](#__RefHeading___Toc148342_63720426) series keyword, then the previous [ACTION](#__RefHeading___Toc148342_63720426) definitions will be replaced by the definition declared by this [ACTIONW](#__RefHeading___Toc152225_2992482751) Definition Section. | None |
| 1-2 | ACTWELL | A character string of up to eight characters in length that defines the well name for which the [ACTIONW](#__RefHeading___Toc152225_2992482751) Definition Section is being defined. Note that the well name (ACTWELL) must have been declared previously using the [WELSPECS](#__RefHeading___Toc268463_1366622701) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section, otherwise an error may occur. | None |
| 1-3 | ACTLHS | A character string of up to eight characters in length that stipulates a well [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) variable on the left hand side of a Boolean conditional test. For example, WOPR that stands for the Well Oil Production Rate. In addition, ACTLHS can also be a well User Defined Quantity (“UDQ”) defined by the [UDQ - Declare User Define Quantities (“UDQ”)](#12.3.59.UDQ - Declare User Define Quantities (“UDQ”)\|outline) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section. In this case, the first two characters of ACTLHS must be set to WU and the [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) variable must have previously been declared with the [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) keyword. A complete list of well [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) vectors that can be used with [ACTIONW](#__RefHeading___Toc152225_2992482751) keyword by OPM Flow and the commercial black-oil simulator is summarized in Table 12.5. | Not Applicable |
| 1-4 | ACTTEST | A defined character string that the defines the Boolean operator and must be set to one of the following Boolean conditionals: Note that the OPM Flow implementation of ACTTEST has been enhanced to support all of the above conditions. Whereas, the commercial simulator only supports (1) and (2). Thus, one should be mindful of this fact if the input deck is to be run by both OPM Flow and the commercial simulator. | Not Applicable |
| 1-5 | ACTRHS | A numeric value that defines the constant on the right hand side of the Boolean conditional test. The set of wells for which the Boolean condition is true, is captured and can be used as a general "well list" with the symbol '?' in subsequent well keywords.  For example, to shut wells with a gas production rate less than 5 MMscf/d, one would use: ACTIONW ACT01 'GP*'  WGPR < 5000.0 10000  / WELOPEN '?'     SHUT                       / / ... ENDACTIO | Not Applicable |
| 1-6 | ACTNSTEP | A positive integer that defines the maximum number times that the ACTNAME action is to be executed. The [ACTIONW](#__RefHeading___Toc152225_2992482751) action is excuted at the end of each time step if at least one well satisfies the Boolean condition until the action has been executed the specified number of times. The default value of one means that the definition will be executed only once. One can use a large value, for example 10,000 for the definition to be executed at every time step. Note that the counter only affects successful evaluations; i.e. if ACTNSTEP is set equal to one (the default), then the simulator will test the action at the end of every time step until it evaluates to true. | 1 |
| 1-3 | ACTINCR | ACTINCR is a real negative or positive value that specifies a value to increment ACTRHS every time the Boolean condition evaluates to true. For example, if ACTINCR is set to 500.0: ACTIONW ACT02 'GP*'  WGPR < 5000.0 10000  500.0 / WELOPEN '?'     SHUT                             / / ... ENDACTIO Then after the third time the Boolean conditional has evaluated to true, the condition would effectively be: ACTIONW ACT02 'GP*'  WGPR < 6500.0 10000  500.0 / ... ENDACTIO | 0.0 |
| 1-4 | / | Record terminated by a “/” | Not Applicable |
|  |  | The next section contains any number of standard [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) keywords that will be executed if the Boolean expression evaluates to true.  For example, to reduce the tubing head pressure constraint when any of the oil producers’ oil rate drop below 100 stb/d then one could use: ACTIONW ACT03 'OP*'  WOPR < 100.0 10000   / -- -- FLOW WELLS THROUGH LOW PRESSURE SEPARATOR -- --  WELL    WELL   TARGET --  NAME    TARG   VALUE WELTARG 'OP*'       THP     150            / / ENDACTIO In theory, most [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) keywords can be used in an [ACTIONW](#__RefHeading___Toc152225_2992482751) Definition Section here, except for the time stepping keywords, i.e, [TSTEP](#__RefHeading___Toc118323_1596574740) and [DATES](#__RefHeading___Toc117621_2179381650). See the [ACTIONX](#__RefHeading___Toc152227_2992482751) keyword for a list of the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) keywords that are known to work with the [ACTION](#__RefHeading___Toc148342_63720426) series of keywords. | Not Applicable |

*Table 12.5: [ACTIONW](#__RefHeading___Toc152225_2992482751) Supported Well [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) Variables*


See also the [ACTDIMS](#__RefHeading___Toc4408_421927891) and [UDADIMS](#__RefHeading___Toc65914_1778172979) keywords in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section to define the dimensions for the [ACTION](#__RefHeading___Toc148342_63720426) series of keywords and associated variables. In addition, the [EXIT](#__RefHeading___Toc627737_1466963378) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section that allows for terminating the simulation for when a condition within an [ACTIONW](#__RefHeading___Toc152225_2992482751) definition is satisfied

Although most [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section keywords should work with the [ACTIONW](#__RefHeading___Toc152225_2992482751) keyword, Table 12.8 under the description of [ACTIONX – Define Action Conditions and Command Processing](#12.3.6.ACTIONX – Define ACTION Conditions and Command Processing|outline) shows the status of keywords that have been tested and known to work, together with keywords that are currently planned to be implemented.

As mentioned previously, the [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) keyword stipulates the variables and operations used to access the User Defined Quantities features in OPM Flow. [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) variables can be constants, [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) variables, as defined in the [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) section, or a formula using various mathematical functions together with constants and [SUMMARY](#__RefHeading___Toc43949_784232322) variables.


| Note Within an [ACTIONW](#__RefHeading___Toc152225_2992482751) Definition Section any [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) variables utilizing well variables, must have their associated wells previously fully defined in the commercial simulator, otherwise an error will occur. For example, if a well’s GOR is being used as part of a [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) definition, then the well must be fully characterized prior to declaring the [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) definition. This restriction does not apply to OPM Flow; however, it should be considered if the same deck is to be run with both simulators. |
| --- |


User Defined Quantities can also be used as User Defined Arguments (“UDA”) in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section with various group, well, and connection keywords. In this case, the UDA variables are used to replace numerical values on these keywords by UDA variables that have been defined by the [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) keyword.  For example, if we wish to make the oil rate for certain wells to be a function of their water cut, then one can define the function using the [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) keyword that results in a [UDQ](#__RefHeading___Toc161095_2932703077) variable, WU_WOPR say, and then use WU_WOPR as a UDA variable on the [WCONPROD](#__RefHeading___Toc146754_4203985108) keyword for the ORAT parameter. See Table 12.76 for a list of keywords that can be used with UDA variables in the [UDQ - Declare User Define Quantities (“UDQ”)](#12.3.59.UDQ - Declare User Define Quantities (“UDQ”)|outline) keyword section.


#### Examples

The first example uses the [ACTIONW](#__RefHeading___Toc152225_2992482751) keyword to re-complete a gas injection well, GI01, when the well’s bottom-hole pressure exceeds the fracture pressure of the formation, and to open up a structurally higher zone in the well. The keyword [NEXTSTEP](#__RefHeading___Toc323446_1841740821) is used to set the next step to 0.1 days to avoid convergence issues due to a well event.

The second example shows how to reduce a producing well's deliverability due to water production. Here, well OP01’s productivity index is reduced by 2% when the well’s liquid production total is greater than 100,000 stb. The reduction is repeated 300 times and each time the action is executed the ACTRHS constant is increased by 10,000 stb.

The final example is similar to the previous example, and shows how to nest [ACTIONW](#__RefHeading___Toc152225_2992482751) blocks and how to apply [ACTIONW](#__RefHeading___Toc152225_2992482751) to all the oil producers when the Boolean condition are satisfied.

In this case the outer [ACTIONW](#__RefHeading___Toc152225_2992482751) checks if the liquid production for each OP* well is great than the calculated ACTRHS constant, if it is, then inner [ACTIONW](#__RefHeading___Toc152225_2992482751) reduces all the selected wells’ productivity indices by 2%, provided the well’s productivity index is greater than five.

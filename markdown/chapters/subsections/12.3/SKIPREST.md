### SKIPREST – Activate Skipping of Restart Schedule Data


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

This keyword turns on skipping of keywords up to the start of the restart point, as defined on the RESTART keyword in the RUNSPEC section. The RESTART keyword defines the parameters to restart the simulation from a previous run that has written a RESTART file out to disk. Activating the SKIPREST keyword causes the simulator to only read in data it requires for restarting the run up to the RESTART point (RSNUM on the RESTART keyword in the SOLUTION section). Note that certain keywords always need to be present in a restart run in the SCHEDULE section as the data is not stored on the RESTART file, for example the VFP tables (VFPPROD and VFPINJ keywords). The SKIPREST keyword automatically processes the input deck and reads the required data.

There is no data required for this keyword.


#### Example

The example below defines a restart from the previously run NOR-OPM-A01 case at time step number 40.


```

--       FLEXIBLE RESTART FROM PREVIOUS SIMULATION RUN
--
--       FILE                   RESTART   RESTART   FILE
--       NAME                   NUMBER    TYPE      FORMAT
RESTART
         'NOR-OPM-A01'          40        1*        1*     /
```


Then in the SCHEDULE section the SKIPREST keyword is used to correctly read in the schedule data up to the RESTART point.

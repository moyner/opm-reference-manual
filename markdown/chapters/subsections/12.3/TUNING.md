#### Description

The TUNING keyword defines the parameters used to control the commercial simulator’s time stepping and numerical convergence for the global grid. The keyword is similar to the [TUNINGDP](#kw-TUNINGDP) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#kw-SCHEDULE) section that is optimized for high throughput runs. The keyword is mostly ignored by OPM Flow; however, the simulator can be instructed to read some parameters from the TUNING keyword if the appropriate command line parameter has been activated (see section 2.2 Running OPM Flow 2023-04 From The Command Line).

: TUNING Keyword Description {#tbl-12-66}
Note that for record number two (items 2-1 to 2-13) the maximum values should always be greater than the associated target value; for example, XXXCNV should be greater than TRGCNV.  Also note that the TUNING keyword is stored on the restart files (see [RPTRST](#kw-RPTRST) – Define Data to be Written to the [RESTART](#kw-RESTART) File) enabling the parameters to be utilized in a restart run without re-specifying the keyword.


#### Example


```
--
--       DEFAULT TUNING PARAMETERS

TUNING
         1.0    365.0     0.1     0.15     3     0.3     0.1   1.25  1E20  1*   /
                                                                                /
                                                                                /

```

The above example explicitly sets the default parameters for OPM Flow for when the appropriate command line parameter has been activated (see section 2.2 Running OPM Flow 2023-04 From The Command Line) to instruct the simulator to read the first record of the TUNING keyword.  Alternatively one could just use the following to accomplish the same thing.

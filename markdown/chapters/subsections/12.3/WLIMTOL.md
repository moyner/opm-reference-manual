#### Description

[WLIMTOL](#__RefHeading___Toc123805_332691817) keyword defines the tolerance to be used for various constraints applied to connections, completions (if connections have been lumped via the [COMPLUMP](#__RefHeading___Toc97655_3261743917) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section), wells, and groups, including the field group. See also the [GCONTOL](#__RefHeading___Toc202994_156692946) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section that sets the tolerance parameters for groups.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

#### Description

This keyword, [CSKIN](#__RefHeading___Toc263614_1539708736), is used to re-define a well’s connection skin factors and as such will result in the well’s connection transmissibility factors being updated accordingly. The well connections must already be defined using the [COMPDAT](#__RefHeading___Toc97651_3261743917) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section before this keyword can be used.

| Field | Metric | Laboratory |  |
| 1 | WELNAME | A character string of up to eight characters in length that defines the well name for which the well connection skin is being re-defined. Note that the well name (WELNAME) must have been declared previously using the [WELSPECS](#__RefHeading___Toc268463_1366622701) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section, otherwise an error may occur. | None |
| 2 | I | A positive integer greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to NX that defines the connection location in the I-direction. If set to zero or defaulted with 1* then connections in any I-direction location will be modified. | 0 |
| 3 | J | A positive integer greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to NY that defines the connection location in the J-direction. If set to zero or defaulted with 1* then connections in any J-direction location will be modified. | 0 |
| 4 | K1 | A positive integer greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to K2 and NZ that defines the UPPER connection location in the K-direction. If set to zero or defaulted with 1* then this will be taken from the top connection of the well. | 0 |
| 5 | K2 | A positive integer greater than or equal to K1 and less than or equal to NZ that defines the LOWER connection location in the K-direction. If set to zero or defaulted with 1* then this will be taken from the bottom connection of the well. | 0 |
| 6 | SKIN | A real value that defines the connections’ dimensionless skin factors. | 0.0 |
| dimensionless | dimensionless | dimensionless |  |

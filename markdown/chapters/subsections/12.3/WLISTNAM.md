### WLISTNAM – Define Well Lists (WLISTARG)


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

WLISTNAM declares a group of wells to belong to a named WLISTARG well list for use with the WLISTARG keyword.  Only the WLISTARG keyword can be used with this type of well list, and therefore it is better to use the WLIST keyword instead, that defines a static well list but offers more flexibility than a WLISTNAM well list.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | :------ | --- |
| 1 | WLIST | A character string of up to eight characters in length, enclosed in quotes, that defines the well list name for the WELLNAMES declared by this record. Note the first character must be asterisk (“*”) and the second character must be a letter, for example, *PROD. | None |
| 2-51 | WELNAMES | A character string of up to eight characters in length that defines the well name that belongs to the named well list (WLIST). A total of 50 well names can be added to WLISTNAM at a time. If the first well name in the list is the default value (“*1”), then the list is first cleared of all wells, before adding the subsequent wells in WELLNAMES. Well names roots may all be used in WELLNAMES as long as they are enclosed in quotes and end with an asterisk (“*”). In this case all wells that match the specification will be added to the list. For example, wells named OP01, OP02 and OP03, can be added as group by using “OP*” as the well name. Note that the well names must have been declared previously using the WELSPECS keyword in the SCHEDULE section, otherwise an error may occur. | 1* |
| Notes: |  |  |  |

*Table 12.106: WLISTNAM Keyword Description*


Note that named well list production data in the SUMMARY file is well dependent, that is, if the wells belonging to a named well list is changed through time, the SUMMARY data will be based on the wells in the named well list group at the end of the run. Thus, if there are three wells in a named well list called *PROD1 at the beginning of a run; OP01, OP02 and OP03, and during the run OP03 is moved to a well named list called *PROD2, then the SUMMARY data for *PROD1will only contain the production data for wells OP01 and OP02 and *PROD2 will only contain the SUMMARY data for OP03 from the start to the end of the run.


#### Example

The following example defines two named well lists using the WLISTNAM keyword.


```
--
--          WELL LIST SPECIFICATION
--
-- LIST     WELL NAME LIST
-- NAME
WLISTNAM
'*BLK-1'    WEL-01M WEL-02M WEL-03M WEL-04M WEL-05M WEL-06M WEL-07M            /
'*BLK-1'    WEL-08M WEL-09M WEL-10M WEL-11M WEL-12M WEL-13M WEL-14M            /
'*BLK-1'    WEL-15M WEL-16M WEL-17M WEL-18M WEL-19M WEL-20M WEL-23M            /
'*BLK-1'    WEL-24M WEL-25M WEL-26M WEL-28M                                    /

'*BLK-2'    1*      WEL-03U WEL-05U WEL-06U WEL-10U WEL-11U WEL-13U WEL-14U    /
'*BLK-2'            WEL-15U WEL-16U WEL-17U WEL-18U WEL-19U WEL-25U WEL-27U    /
/

```

Here well list '’*BLK-1’ contains 28 wells, that is wells WEL-01M to WEL-28M. For the '*BLK-2' well list all wells are first deleted due to the “1*” default value and then wells WEL-03U to  WEL-27U are added to the list.

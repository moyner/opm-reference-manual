### WAPI – Define Oil Well Injection API Gravity


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |

#### Description

This keyword defines an oil injection well’s API gravity for when API tracking has been made active via the API keyword in the RUNSPEC section. The American Petroleum Institute (API) classifies oils based on an API gravity (γAPI),  or degrees API (oAPI), the relationship between relative density (γo) of oil and API gravity (γAPI) is given by:


| $$ {\mathrm{γ}}_{\mathit{API}} = \frac{141.5}{{\mathrm{γ}}_{o}} - 131.5 $$ | (12.33) |

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

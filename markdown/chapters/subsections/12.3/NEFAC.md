#### Description

The NEFAC keyword defines an extended network node’s efficiency factor, for when the Extended Network option has been activated by the [NETWORK](#kw-NETWORK) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#kw-RUNSPEC) section.  See also the [GEFAC](#kw-GEFAC) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#kw-SCHEDULE) section that can also be used with the Extended Network option.

| 1 | NODE | A character string of up to eight characters in length that defines the node name for which the node efficiency factor is being defined. | None |
| 2 | FACTOR | A real positive value that is less than or equal to one that defines the efficiency factor for the node. If a node’s down time is 5% then FACTOR should be set to 0.95 (1.0 – 0.05). | 1.0 |

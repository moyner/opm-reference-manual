#### Description

The [NEFAC](#__RefHeading___Toc299702_1841740821) keyword defines an extended network node’s efficiency factor, for when the Extended Network option has been activated by the [NETWORK](#__RefHeading___Toc311583_1841740821) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section.  See also the [GEFAC](#__RefHeading___Toc268455_1366622701) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section that can also be used with the Extended Network option.

| 1 | NODE | A character string of up to eight characters in length that defines the node name for which the node efficiency factor is being defined. | None |
| 2 | FACTOR | A real positive value that is less than or equal to one that defines the efficiency factor for the node. If a node’s down time is 5% then FACTOR should be set to 0.95 (1.0 – 0.05). | 1.0 |
| dimensionless | dimensionless | dimensionless |  |

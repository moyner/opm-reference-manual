#### Description

The [LGRLOCK](#__RefHeading___Toc264711_2843394514) keyword deactivates the Local Grid Refinement (“LGR”) Independent Time Step option that allows the [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) to have solution time steps independent of the host grid for the stated [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650), that is the [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) will now follow the global grid solution time steps. LGRs must have declared by the [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section, and defined by the [CARFIN](#__RefHeading___Toc150726_63720426) (Cartesian [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) grid) or RADIN/RADIN4 (radial [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) grid) keywords in the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) section. [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) independent solution time stepping can be activated by the [LGRFREE](#__RefHeading___Toc259100_2843394514) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section.

Currently, OPM Flow does not support the local grid refinement feature and therefore this keyword is ignored by the simulator.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | LGRNAME | A character string of up to eight characters in length that defines the [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) name for which independent solution time stepping is to be deactivated. The [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) must have been previously defined by the [CARFIN](#__RefHeading___Toc150726_63720426) (Cartesian [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) grid) or RADIN/RADIN4 (radial [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) grid) keywords in the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) section. | None |

#### Example

The example below defines three oil LGRs(LGR-OP01,-OP02, and -OP03) and all the gas well LGRs (LGR-GP*) that should have their independent solution time steps deactivated.

### TUNINGH – Numerical Tuning Control for History Match Gradient Calculations


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

Defines the parameters used for controlling the commercial simulator’s numerical convergence parameters. The keyword is similar to the TUNING keyword in the SCHEDULE section, but the defaults on this keyword are optimized for high throughput runs. See section 2.2 Running OPM Flow 2023-04 From The Command Line on how to invoke various numerical schemes via the OPM Flow command line interface.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but has no effect on the results so it will be ignored.

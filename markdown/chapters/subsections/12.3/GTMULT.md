### GTMULT – Multiply Group Target or Constraint by a Constant

#### Description

This keyword, GTMULT, multiplies a group’s target or constraint value by a numerical constant. The group must have been initially fully defined using the GCONPROD or GCONPRI keywords for producers or GCONINJE for injectors. Variables not changed by the GTMULT keyword remain the same as those previously entered via the group control keywords or previously entered GTMULT keywords. See also the GRUPTARG keyword that sets the values for a group’s target and constraints, and the GTADD keyword that adds a constant to a group’s target or constraint.  All the aforementioned keywords are described in the SCHEDULE section.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

#### Description

[WSURFACT](#__RefHeading___Toc1103962_4263943340) defines a water injection well’s surfactant concentration in the injection stream that is to be used when the Surfactant phase has been activated by either the [SURFACT](#__RefHeading___Toc863854_4250154414) or [SURFACTW](#__RefHeading___Toc863864_4250154414) keywords in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

| Field | Metric | Laboratory |  |
| 1 | WELNAME | A character string of up to eight characters in length that defines the well name of a gas injection well for which the solvent fraction data is being defined. Note that the well name (WELNAME) must have been declared previously using the [WELSPECS](#__RefHeading___Toc268463_1366622701) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section, otherwise an error may occur. | None |
| 2 | SURCON | A real positive value that defines the surfactant concentration of the well’s injection stream. | None |
| lb/stb | kg/sm3 | gm/scc |  |
| Notes: |  |  |  |

*Table 12.125: WSURFACT Keyword Description*


Water injection wells that are not declared via this keyword have their surfactant concentrations set to zero.

See also the [GCONINJE](#__RefHeading___Toc134874_2055188184) keyword to define a group’s injection targets and constraints, and the [WCONINJE](#__RefHeading___Toc146750_4203985108) keyword to define an injection well’s targets and constraints. All the aforementioned keywords are described in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section.


#### Example

The following example defines the surfactant concentrations for three water injection wells for when the surfactant phase option has been activated by either the [SURFACT](#__RefHeading___Toc863854_4250154414) or [SURFACTW](#__RefHeading___Toc863864_4250154414) keywords in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section.  Here the surfactant concentration has been set to 0.200 for all three wells.

#### Description

The [RIVTRACE](#__RefHeading___Toc693709_501926209) keyword defines the injected tracer concentration in individual river branches in a previously characterized river system using the [RIVERSYS](#__RefHeading___Toc674955_501926209) and the [REACHES](#__RefHeading___Toc643464_501926209) keywords in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section.  The River option must be activated via the [RIVRDIMS](#__RefHeading___Toc681201_501926209) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section in order to use this keyword.  In addition, the Tracer option must also be enabled by the [TRACER](#__RefHeading___Toc121485_83452205) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

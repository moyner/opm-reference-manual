#### Description

This keyword, GTADD, adds a numerical constant to a group’s target or constraint value. The group must have been initially fully defined using the GCONPROD or GCONPRI keywords for producers or GCONINJE for injectors.   Variables not changed by the GTADD keyword remain the same as those previously entered via the group control keywords or previously entered GTADD keywords. See also the GRUPTARG keyword that sets the values for a group’s target and constraints and the GTMULT keyword that multiplies a group target or constraint by a constant.  All the aforementioned keywords are described in the SCHEDULE section.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

### SIMULATE – Activate the Simulation Mode


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

SIMULATE switches the mode of the simulation to run simulation mode from the data input checking mode activated by the NOSIM keyword in the SCHEDULE section. Note that if NOSIM has been used in the RUNSPEC section then SIMULATE will have no effect.

There is no data required for this keyword and there is no terminating “/” for this keyword.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.


#### Example

The example below switches OPM Flow to no simulation mode for data checking of the input deck.


```
--
--       ACTIVATE SIMULATION MODE TO RUN THE MODEL
--
SIMULATE
```

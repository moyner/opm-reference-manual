#### Description

[WDFACCOR](#__RefHeading___Toc48144_327352552) keyword defines the parameters to calculate a gas well’s connection D-factors (flow dependent skin factor) for each connection based on a correlation for the coefficient of inertial resistance, usually known as β, in Forchheimer’s flow equation [Dake, L.P. Fundamentals of Reservoir Engineering, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Elsevier Science BV (1978)  Chapter 8.6, pages 252-257.], [Geertsma, J., 1974. Estimating the Coefficient of Inertial Resistance in Fluid Flow Through Porous Media. Soc.Pet.Eng.J., October: 445-450.],  [Gewers, C.W.W. and Nichol, L.R., 1969. Gas Turbulence Factor in a Microvugular Carbonate. J.Can.Pet.Tech., April.] and  [Wong, S.W., 1970. Effects of Liquid Saturation on Turbulence Factors for Gas Liquid Systems. J.Can.Pet.Tech., October]. This keyword uses Dake’s correlation to calculate the D-factor.

The simulator evaluates the connection D-factors using the following expression based on Dake’s correlation:


|  | (12.3.260.1) |
| --- | --- |

Where:

	= effective permeability of the grid block,

	= porosity of the grid block,

	= connection length,

	= wellbore radius,

	= gas gravity at surface conditions,

	= gas viscosity at bottom hole conditions.


Note that since  is dependent on pressure the D-factor will also vary with pressure.

See also the [WDFAC](#__RefHeading___Toc442057_2026549522) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section that can be used to specify the well D-factor; and the [COMPDAT](#__RefHeading___Toc97651_3261743917) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section that can be used to specify the connection D-factors directly.


#### Examples

In the first example the connection D-factors for gas well GP01 are evaluated for correlation coefficients specified in field units based on the laboratory determined relationship between β and the absolute permeability presented by Dake in Fig. 8.8 (variation of β with porosity has been neglected).

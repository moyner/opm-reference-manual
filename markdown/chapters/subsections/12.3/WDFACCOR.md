#### Description

WDFACCOR keyword defines the parameters to calculate a gas well’s connection D-factors (flow dependent skin factor) for each connection based on a correlation for the coefficient of inertial resistance, usually known as β, in Forchheimer’s flow equation^[Dake, L.P. Fundamentals of Reservoir Engineering, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Elsevier Science BV (1978)  Chapter 8.6, pages 252-257.],^[Geertsma, J., 1974. Estimating the Coefficient of Inertial Resistance in Fluid Flow Through Porous Media. Soc.Pet.Eng.J., October: 445-450.], ^[Gewers, C.W.W. and Nichol, L.R., 1969. Gas Turbulence Factor in a Microvugular Carbonate. J.Can.Pet.Tech., April.] and ^[Wong, S.W., 1970. Effects of Liquid Saturation on Turbulence Factors for Gas Liquid Systems. J.Can.Pet.Tech., October]. This keyword uses Dake’s correlation to calculate the D-factor.

*Table 12.3.260.1: WDFACCOR Keyword Description*


The simulator evaluates the connection D-factors using the following expression based on Dake’s correlation:


$$
D = A{K}_{e}^{B}{ϕ}^{C}\frac{{K}_{e}}{h}\frac{1}{{r}_{w}}\frac{{γ}_{g}}{{μ}_{g}}
$$ {#eq-12-3-260-1}

Where:

${K}_{e}$	= effective permeability of the grid block,

$ϕ$	= porosity of the grid block,

$h$	= connection length,

${r}_{w}$	= wellbore radius,

${γ}_{g}$	= gas gravity at surface conditions,

${μ}_{g}$	= gas viscosity at bottom hole conditions.


Note that since ${μ}_{g}$ is dependent on pressure the D-factor will also vary with pressure.

See also the WDFAC keyword in the SCHEDULE section that can be used to specify the well D-factor; and the COMPDAT keyword in the SCHEDULE section that can be used to specify the connection D-factors directly.


#### Examples

In the first example the connection D-factors for gas well GP01 are evaluated for correlation coefficients specified in field units based on the laboratory determined relationship between β and the absolute permeability presented by Dake in Fig. 8.8 (variation of β with porosity has been neglected).

#### Description

The [WPAVEDEP](#__RefHeading___Toc121639_2412586160) keyword defines the reference depth to be used to calculate and report grid block average bottom-hole pressures for a well. This keyword can be used to override the values entered or defaulted on the [WELSPECS](#__RefHeading___Toc268463_1366622701) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section. The simulator corrects the grid block calculated pressures to a well’s reference depth using the hydrostatic well of the producing fluids.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | Metric | Laboratory |  |
| 1 | WELNAME | A character string of up to eight characters in length that defines the well name for which the well and well connection status data is being defined. Note that the well name (WELNAME) must have been declared previously using the [WELSPECS](#__RefHeading___Toc268463_1366622701) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section, otherwise an error may occur. | None |
| 2 | BHPREF | A real value that defines the reference depth for reporting the bottom-hole pressure for the well. Ideally this value should be set to the midpoint of the perforations as defined by the [COMPDAT](#__RefHeading___Toc97651_3261743917) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section. If defaulted by 1* or set to a value less than or equal to zero, then the mid-point of shallowest connection defined by the [COMPDAT](#__RefHeading___Toc97651_3261743917) keyword will be used. | Mid-point of shallowest connection defined by the [COMPDAT](#__RefHeading___Toc97651_3261743917) keyword |

*Table 12.109: WPAVDEP Keyword Description*


See also the [WELSPECS](#__RefHeading___Toc268463_1366622701) keyword that defines a well, the [COMPDAT](#__RefHeading___Toc97651_3261743917) keyword to define a well’s connections, and the [WPAVE](#__RefHeading___Toc121923_2556401936) for defining how the average bottom-hole pressure should be calculated. All the aforementioned keywords are described in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section.


| Note The keyword is normally used to reset a well’s bottom-hole pressure depth to match the pressure gauge depth for when observed pressure is available, for example when conducting a history match for a well test, or when attempting to match static bottom-hole surveys conducted on a well. |

#### Example

The following example illustrates how to set the bottom-hole reference depth for wells completed in different reservoirs that have different datum depths. Here it is assumed that all wells in a reservoir A have RES-A as part of their well name, and similarly for reservoirs B and C.

```


In the example the all wells dedicated to RES-A will have their bottom-hole reference depth set to 3,000 ft. TVDSS, RES-B wells to 3,300 ft. TVDSS and well RES-C wells to 5909 ft. TVDSS.

### WHISTCTL – Define Well Historical Target Phase


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The WHISTCTL keyword changes the target control for wells declared as history match wells via the WCONHIST keyword in the SCHEDULE section. The target phase is set on the WCONHIST keyword and WHISTCTL overrides this value for all subsequent entries on the WCONHIST keyword.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | Metric | Laboratory |  |
| 1 | TARGET | A defined character string that sets the observed target production phase for the well, all the other phases are calculated unconstrained and used for reporting only. The simulator will attempt to meet the TARGET based on the phase rate stated in items (4) to (6) and (10) on the WCONHIST keyword. TARGET should be set to one of the following character strings: | None |
| 2 | END | A defined character string that defines if the simulation should terminate if the well has switch to BHP control by the simulator, and should be set to one of the following character strings: Wells set to BHP control via the WCONHIST or WHISCTL keywords are ignored. Only END equal to NO is currently supported in OPM Flow. | NO |

*Table 12.98: WHISTCTL Keyword Description*


History matching wells are handled differently then ordinary wells that use the WCONPROD keyword for controlling their production targets and constraints. However, the wells still need to be defined like ordinary production wells using the WELSPECS keyword in the SCHEDULE section. History matching wells are converted to ordinary wells by restating a well’s control mode using either the WCONPROD or WELTARG keywords in the SCHEDULE section.

See also the WCONHIST and WCONINJH keywords that are used to define the historical production and injection data,  All the aforementioned keywords are described in the SCHEDULE section.


#### Example

The example below shows the observed gas rates for the OP01 oil producer for the first quarter of 2000.

From January 1, 2000 the WCONHIST keyword defines well OP01, which is open and is on oil rate control, to produce 15,500 stb/d oil, with the observed rates of 100 stb/d of water and 15.5 MMscf/d of gas. However the WHISCTL keyword resets the target control to reservoir voidage from January 1, 2000 and onward. This is useful in initial history matching runs to get a “reasonable” pressure match, by ensuring that the total reservoir withdrawals are correct, although the individual phase withdrawals will not match. Once a reasonable pressure match is achieved for the reservoir then one can reset TARGET to the sales phase, OIL or GAS, and continue with the matching of all the phases.

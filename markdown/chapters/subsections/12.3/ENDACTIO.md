### ENDACTIO – End the Definition of ACTION Commands


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The ENDACTIO keyword defines the end of a series of conditions that invoke run time processing of the ACTION series of keywords, namely: ACTION, ACTIONG, ACTIONR, ACTIONS, ACTIONW and ACTIONX. Only the ACTIONX keyword is implemented in OPM Flow as this keyword implements the ACTION, ACTIONG, ACTIONR, ACTIONS, ACTIONW functionality with greater flexibility.  See the ACTIONX keyword in the SCHEDULE section for a full description of the ACTION facility.

There is no data required for this keyword and there is no terminating “/” for this keyword.


#### Example

The example shows the use of the ACTIONX and ENDACTIO keywords to test if the field’s gas production rate is less than 600 MMscf/d after 2020 and to open up additional wells if this occurs.

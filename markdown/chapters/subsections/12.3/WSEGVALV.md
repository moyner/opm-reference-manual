#### Description

The [WSEGVALV](#__RefHeading___Toc1091865_4263943340) keyword defines a multi-segment well segment to be a sub-critical valve Inflow Control Device (“ICD”) as part of a completion for a multi-segment well. Note that the well must have been previously defined by the [WELSPECS](#__RefHeading___Toc268463_1366622701) and [WELSEGS](#__RefHeading___Toc97661_3261743917) keywords in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section and that the data for the keyword should be repeated for each multi-segment completion that contains a sub-critical valve ICD.

An ICD is a well completion component usually installed along the producing section of a well to minimize the unwanted water and gas breakthrough in an oil well, or early water production in a gas well, due to an uneven flow profile over the completed interval.  Permeability variations over the producing interval cause the high permeability zones to produce higher quantities of fluids than the lower permeability zones and this uneven producing fluid profile may result in bypassed hydrocarbons. Secondly, for horizontal wells, the pressure loss from the “toe” to the “heel” of the well again results in an uneven fluid profile over the producing interval. In order to rectify this ICDs can be installed so that the well fluids have to flow through an ICD before entering the tubing; thus, creating an additional “designed” pressure loss.

A sub-critical valve ICD is a type of frictional ICD that adds an additional pressure loss by directing the fluid through a constriction before entering the tubing. The pressure drop is a function of the fluid density, the volumetric flow rate, and the diameter of the constriction. By placing various ICD’s over the production interval one can design a completion that results in a more uniform producing fluid profile throughout the length of the producing interval.

| 5 | SEGLEN | A real positive value greater than or equal to zero that defines the additional pipe length for the frictional pressure drop (L). If set to zero then there is no additional pressure loss due to friction, whereas,  if set to the default (1*), then the segment pipe length is calculated from the corresponding [WELSEGS](#__RefHeading___Toc97661_3261743917) keyword. | Defined |
| ft | m | cm |  |
| 6 | ID | A real positive value that defines the pipe internal diameter of the segment used to calculate the pressure drop due to friction (D). The value is used to replace the segment pipe internal diameter defined on the [WELSEGS](#__RefHeading___Toc97661_3261743917) keyword in record 2-7, also named ID.  If ID is defaulted on this keyword then the equivalent value on the [WELSEGS](#__RefHeading___Toc97661_3261743917) keyword will be used instead. Note for non-circular pipe segments use the equivalent diameter instead, that is: | Defined |

The value is used to replace the segment pipe absolute roughness defined on the [WELSEGS](#__RefHeading___Toc97661_3261743917) keyword in record 2-8, also named EPSILON.

The value is used to replace the segment pipe cross-sectional area of flow defined on the [WELSEGS](#__RefHeading___Toc97661_3261743917) keyword in record 2-9, named XAREA.  If AREAPIPE is defaulted on this keyword then the equivalent value on the [WELSEGS](#__RefHeading___Toc97661_3261743917) keyword will be used instead. | Defined |
| ft2 | m2 | cm2 |  |

AREAMAX is used to convert the segment volumetric flow rate into the maximum flow velocity at the constriction (υr). If defaulted then AREAPIPE will be used if defined, otherwise XAREA (item 2-9) on the [WELSEGS](#__RefHeading___Toc97661_3261743917) keyword will be used. | Defined |

*Table 12.121: WSEGVALV Keyword Description*


The total number of wells should be defined via the [WELLDIMS](#__RefHeading___Toc82886_327352552) keyword and the number of multi-segment wells should be declared on the [WSEGDIMS](#__RefHeading___Toc104259_3115110868) keyword, both keywords are in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section. In addition, the [WELSPECS](#__RefHeading___Toc268463_1366622701) keyword should be used to define wells, the [COMPDAT](#__RefHeading___Toc97651_3261743917) keyword to define the well completions for both ordinary wells and multi-segment wells, and the [COMPSEGS](#__RefHeading___Toc316604_3519154785) keyword to define a multi-segment segment completions. Finally, the [WSEGVALV](#__RefHeading___Toc1091865_4263943340) keyword can then be use to define ICD connections for the well.  All the aforementioned keywords are described in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section.

OPM flow calculates the pressure drop across the ICD using a homogeneous sub-critical flow through a constriction model. The model consists of two variables, the pressure drop due to the constriction,, and the pressure drop due to friction,, as shown in equation (12.42).

Here segments 7, 12 and 17 have the same type of sub-critical valves with their pipe properties taken from the [WELSEGS](#__RefHeading___Toc97661_3261743917) keyword used to define well OP01 as a multi-segment well. Similarly, segments 22 to 25 have the same ICD properties, and again the pipe properties are taken from the [WELSEGS](#__RefHeading___Toc97661_3261743917) keyword.

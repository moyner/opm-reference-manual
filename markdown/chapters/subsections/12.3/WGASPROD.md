#### Description

The [WGASPROD](#__RefHeading___Toc121396_332691817) keyword declares wells to be Sales Gas producers and sets the incremental gas rate for a well and the maximum number of increments that this rate can be increased. Wells must have been previously been defined via the [WELSPECS](#__RefHeading___Toc268463_1366622701) and [WCONPROD](#__RefHeading___Toc146754_4203985108) keywords in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section and are subject to any targets or constraints on [WCONPROD](#__RefHeading___Toc146754_4203985108) keyword.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

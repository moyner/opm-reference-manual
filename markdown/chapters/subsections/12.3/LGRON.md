#### Description

The [LGRON](#__RefHeading___Toc281550_2843394514) keyword activates a stated Local Grid Refinement (“LGR”) and optionally sets the minimum number of wells above which the [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) will remain active. LGRs must have declared by the [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section, and defined by the [CARFIN](#__RefHeading___Toc150726_63720426) (Cartesian [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) grid) or RADIN/RADIN4 (radial [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) grid) keywords in the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) section. LGRs can subsequently be deactivated by the [LGROFF](#__RefHeading___Toc281548_2843394514) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section.

Currently, OPM Flow does not support the local grid refinement feature and therefore this keyword is ignored by the simulator.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | LGRNAME | A character string of up to eight characters in length that defines the [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) name for which the [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) is being activated. The [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) must have been previously defined by the [CARFIN](#__RefHeading___Toc150726_63720426) (Cartesian [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) grid) or RADIN/RADIN4 (radial [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) grid) keywords in the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) section. | None |
| 2 | MNWELLS | A positive integer greater than or equal to zero that defines the minimum number of active wells, below which the [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) will be automatically deactivated. The default value of zero implies that there is no limit to the number of wells and results in the [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650) being unconditionally being activated. | 0 |

*Table 12.51: LGRON Keyword Description*


#### Example

The example below unconditionally activates LGR-OP01, and sets the minimum number of active wells for  activating LGR-OP02 and LGR-OP03 to one. For all the gas well LGRs (LGR-GP*) the minimum number of wells for activating these LGRs is set to two.

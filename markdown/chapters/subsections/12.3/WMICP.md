#### Description

The [WMICP](#__RefHeading___Toc473082_111689907) keyword defines a water injection well's microbial, growth, and cementation injection stream solutions, where the rate-limiting components are suspended microbes, oxygen, and urea concentrations respectively. These concentrations are used when the [MICP](#__RefHeading___Toc383375_111689907) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section has been used  to activate OPM Flow’s Microbially Induced Calcite Precipitation model. See Landa-Marbán et al [Landa-Marbán, D., Tveit, S., Kumar, K., Gasda, S.E., 2021. Practical approaches to study microbially induced calcite precipitation at the eld scale. Int. J. Greenh. Gas Control 106, 103256. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijggc.2021.103256.] and  [Landa-Marbán, D., Kumar, K., Tveit, S., Gasda, S.E., 2021.

(Eds) Short Papers from the 11th International Trondheim CCS conference, ISBN: 978-82-536-1714-5, 284-290.] for a description of the model.

Note the keyword should only be used for wells declared as water injection wells via the [WCONINJE](#__RefHeading___Toc146750_4203985108) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section.

*Table 12.107: WMICP Keyword Description*


Water injection wells that are not declared via this keyword have their concentrations defaulted to zero.


#### Example


```
--
--       DEFINE WATER INJECTION WELL MICROBIAL, OXYGEN, AND UREA CONCENTRATIONS
--
-- WELL  MICROBIAL  OXYGEN     UREA
-- NAME  MICRCON    OXYGCON    UREACON
--       --------   --------   --------
WMICP
WI01     0.01                                    /
WI02     1*         0.04                         /
WI03     1*         1*         60.0              /
WI04     1*         0.04       60.0              /
/

```

Here the microbial concentration for well WI01 is set to 0.01, the oxygen concentration for well WI02 is set to 0.04, the urea concentration for well WI03 is set to 60, and the oxygen and urea concentrations for well WI04 are set to 0.04 and 60 respectively.

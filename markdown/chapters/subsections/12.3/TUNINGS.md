### TUNINGS – Numerical Tuning Control for Individual LGRs


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

TUNINGS defines the parameters used for controlling the commercial simulator’s numerical convergence parameters for individual Local Grid Refinements ("LGR"). The keyword is similar to the TUNINGL keyword in the SCHEDULE section that applies the tuning parameters to the all LGRs, except for an additional first record that includes the LGR name.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but has no effect on the results so it will be ignored.

See section 2.2 Running OPM Flow 2023-04 From The Command Line on how to invoke various numerical schemes via the OPM Flow command line interface.

*Table 12.70: TUNINGS Keyword Description*


Note that for record number two (items 2-1 to 2-13) the maximum values should always be greater than the associated target value; for example, XXXCNV should be greater than TRGCNV.  Also note that the TUNING keyword is stored on the restart files (see RPTRST – Define Data to be Written to the RESTART File) enabling the parameters to be utilized in a restart run without re-specifying the keyword.


See also the TUNINGL keyword in the SCHEDULE section that sets the tuning parameters for all LGRs.

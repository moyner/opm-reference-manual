#### Description

The [WSEGDFIN](#__RefHeading___Toc978481_4263943340) keyword defines a multi-segment well’s drift flux slip model parameters.  A slip model [Shi, H., Holmes, J.A., Durlofsky, L. J., Aziz, K., Diaz, L. R., Alkaya, B., and Oddie, G. “Drift-Flux Modeling of Two-Phase Flow in Wellbores,” paper SPE 84228, Society of Petroleum Engineers Journal (2005) 10, No. 1, 24-33; also presented as “Drift-Flux Modeling of Multiphase Flow in Wellbores,” at the SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, Denver, Colorado, USA(October 5-8, 2003).] and  [Shi, H., Holmes, J.A., Diaz, L. R., Durlofsky, L. J., and Aziz, K. “Drift-Flux Parameters for Three-Phase Steady-State Flow in Wellbores,” paper SPE 89836, Society of Petroleum Engineers Journal(2005) 10, No. 2, 130-137; also presented at the SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, Houston, Texas, USA (September 26-29, 2004).] enables the different phases in the wellbore to flow at different velocities, for example gas will flow up the tubing at a higher velocity than oil and water. The option is activated by the FLOWOPT parameter on the [WELSEGS](#__RefHeading___Toc97661_3261743917) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section; however, the slip model flow calculation is not available in OPM Flow.

See also the WSEGFMD keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section that sets which type of slip model should be used.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

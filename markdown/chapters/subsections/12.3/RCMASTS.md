#### Description

[RCMASTS](#__RefHeading___Toc637253_501926209) is used when reservoir coupling is invoked by the [GRUPMAST](#__RefHeading___Toc488185_1414963541) and [SLAVES](#__RefHeading___Toc1268538_516898843) keywords in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section. The keyword should be placed within the master file and it sets the minimum time step size for groups for when a group is being restricted by a group’s limiting flow rate fractional change (see the [GRUPMAST](#__RefHeading___Toc488185_1414963541) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section).

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

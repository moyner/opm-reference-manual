#### Description

The [WHEDREFD](#__RefHeading___Toc1067814_487874538) keyword sets the hydraulic head reference depth for reporting the hydraulic head pressure for the well, for wells that have previously been defined by the [WELSPECS](#__RefHeading___Toc268463_1366622701) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | Metric | Laboratory |  |
| 1 | WELNAME | A character string of up to eight characters in length that defines the well name for which the well hydraulic head reference depth data is being defined. | None |
| 2 | HYDREF | A real value that defines the hydraulic head reference depth for reporting the hydraulic head pressure for the well. HYDREF cannot be defaulted on the keyword; however if a well has not been set by this keyword HYDREF is set equal to the value on the [HYDRHEAD](#__RefHeading___Toc195463_2135714711) keyword. | None |

See also the [HYDRHEAD](#__RefHeading___Toc195463_2135714711) keyword in the [PROPS](#__RefHeading___Toc39329_784232322) section.


#### Example

The following example defines three wells hydraulic head reference depths for reporting, using the [WHEDREFD](#__RefHeading___Toc1067814_487874538) keyword


```
--
--       WELL HYDRAULIC HEAD REFERENCE DEPTH
--
-- WELL  HYDREF
-- NAME  DEPTH
WHEDREFD
OP01     150.0                                                                 /
OP02     175.0                                                                 /
OP03     150.0                                                                 /
/
```


Here, well OP01 and OP03 have their hydraulic head reference depths set to 150.0 ft and well OP02’s hydraulic head reference depth is set to 175.0 ft.

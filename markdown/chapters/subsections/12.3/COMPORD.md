#### Description

The [COMPORD](#__RefHeading___Toc97657_3261743917) keyword defines how the well connection data entered on the [COMPDAT](#__RefHeading___Toc97651_3261743917) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section are to be ordered for a well.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | Metric | Laboratory |  |
| 1 | WELNAME | A character string of up to eight characters in length that defines the well name for which the well connection data are being defined. Note that the well name (WELNAME) must have been declared previously using the [WELSPECS](#__RefHeading___Toc268463_1366622701) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section, otherwise an error may occur. | None |
| 2 | [COMPORD](#__RefHeading___Toc97657_3261743917) | A character string that defines the method for ordering the well connections given on the [COMPDAT](#__RefHeading___Toc97651_3261743917) keyword, and should be set to [DEPTH](#__RefHeading___Toc58139_3701168388), INPUT, or TRACK. All options are now supported by OPM Flow. | TRACK |

| Note If visual inspection of the well trajectories in the model indicate problematic or unrealistic well connections, the options on this keyword may be useful in correcting the issue. |

#### Example

The following example defines the connections for two vertical oil wells using the [COMPDAT](#__RefHeading___Toc97651_3261743917) keyword and the [COMPORD](#__RefHeading___Toc97657_3261743917) to defined the connection ordering for the wells.

```

The [DEPTH](#__RefHeading___Toc58139_3701168388) option has been chosen because both wells are vertical. Also one could use the following format instead for the [COMPORD](#__RefHeading___Toc97657_3261743917):


```
--
--       DEFINE WELL CONNECTION ORDERING
--
-- WELL  COMPL
-- NAME  ORDER
COMPORD
*        DEPTH                                             /
/
```


as both wells should utilize the [DEPTH](#__RefHeading___Toc58139_3701168388) option. This version would set all wells in the model to [DEPTH](#__RefHeading___Toc58139_3701168388) connection ordering.

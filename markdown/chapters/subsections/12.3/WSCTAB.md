### WSCTAB – Assign Well Scale Deposition and Scale Damage Tables


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

WSCTAB assigns scale deposition and scale damage tables to a well, for when the Scale Deposition option has been activated by declaring the dimensions of the scaling deposition tables using the SCDPDIMS keyword in the RUNSPEC section. Scale deposits reduce the productivity of well and this relationship is defined in the SCDPTAB and SCDATAB keywords in the SCHEDULE section, and are allocated to a well by the WSCTAB keyword.

See also the WPIMULT keyword in the SCHEDULE section that adjusts a well’s productivity index by a constant value.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

### WRFT – Activate Well RFT Reporting to the RFT File


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

This keyword activates reporting of a well’s pressure and saturation profile versus depth for the connected grid blocks, to the RFT file for the requested wells at the time the keyword is activated. Data written out by OPM Flow is used to match the field measured data collected from a Repeat Formation Tester (“RFT”) tool.

The RFT tool is an open hole device which is an updated version of the Formation Interval Tester (“FIT”), both of which are run on wire line. Both tools take multiple pressure readings (at various depths) thus enabling a pressure depth profile to be obtained from the formation, and, in addition, they can also take fluid samples from the formation. The latest tool available from Schlumberger is the Modular Formation Dynamics Tester (“MDT”), which, as its name suggests, is a modular tool that can be assembled in different configurations depending on what are the objectives for running the tool. Note other vendors have similar wire line logging tools with alternative names for the tools. Throughout this section the term RFT applies to all tools that measure a pressure profile versus depth (RFT/FIT/MDT etc.).


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | Metric | Laboratory |  |
| 1 | WELNAME | A columnar vector of character strings of up to eight characters in length for each item,  that defines the well name for which the RFT data should be written to the RFT file. Note that the WELNAME must have been declared previously using the WELSPECS keyword in the SCHEDULE section, otherwise an error may occur. If the WELNAME is left blank then the data is written out for all wells at the time they are first opened to flow. If the WELNAME is given, then the RFT data for the well at the time step the keyword is invoked is written out. | None |
| Notes: |  |  |  |

*Table 12.115: WRFT Keyword Description*


See also the WRFTPLT keyword in the SCHEDULE section that has more flexible reporting options.


#### Examples

The first example activates RFT reporting for all wells at the time a well is first opened to flow:


```
--
--       ACTIVATE WELL RFT REPORTING TO THE RFT FILE
--
-- WELL
-- NAME
WRFT
/

```

Ideally, this version of the keyword should be place at the beginning of the SCHEDULE section to obtain the data for the wells in the run before they are opened up through time.

The next example shows how to use the keyword to request the output for several wells at different reporting time steps.

In this example, both well’s have their RFT written out on February 1 and March 1 2000.

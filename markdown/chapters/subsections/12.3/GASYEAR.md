#### Description

This keyword advances the simulation over one or more gas contract years for when the Gas Field Operations option has been activated by the [GASFIELD](#__RefHeading___Toc195426_1190369742) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section.  A contract year in this case is the period over which the Daily Contract Quantity is fixed, this can a be year, this keyword or the [GASPERIO](#__RefHeading___Toc206080_1190369742) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section, or one or more months. If the contract period is over one or more months then the [GASPERIO](#__RefHeading___Toc206080_1190369742) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section can be used instead of [GASYEAR](#__RefHeading___Toc493664_1414963541).

[GASYEAR](#__RefHeading___Toc493664_1414963541) is an alternative to the [DATES](#__RefHeading___Toc117621_2179381650), [TIME](#__RefHeading___Toc1252966_4250154414) and [TSTEP](#__RefHeading___Toc118323_1596574740) keywords in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section that advances the simulation to a given report time after which additional keywords may be entered to instruct OPM Flow to perform additional functions via the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section keywords.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

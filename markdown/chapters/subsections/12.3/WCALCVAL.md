#### Description

This keyword defines a gas well’s calorific value for when the Gas Calorific Value option has been activated by specifying a target calorific value for a group via the [GCONCAL](#__RefHeading___Toc254086_1190369742) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section. If this option is invoked then the gas calorific value must be set either by this keyword for a well by well allocation of the calorific value, or by using the Tracer Tracking option (activated by the [TRACER](#__RefHeading___Toc121485_83452205) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section) combined with [CALTRAC](#__RefHeading___Toc229773_3519154785) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#__RefHeading___Toc43945_784232322) section that defines the tracer for the calorific value.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

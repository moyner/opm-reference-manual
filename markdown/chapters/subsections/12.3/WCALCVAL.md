### WCALCVAL – Define Gas Well Calorific Value


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

This keyword defines a gas well’s calorific value for when the Gas Calorific Value option has been activated by specifying a target calorific value for a group via the GCONCAL keyword in the SCHEDULE section. If this option is invoked then the gas calorific value must be set either by this keyword for a well by well allocation of the calorific value, or by using the Tracer Tracking option (activated by the TRACER keyword in the RUNSPEC section) combined with CALTRAC keyword in the SCHEDULE section that defines the tracer for the calorific value.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

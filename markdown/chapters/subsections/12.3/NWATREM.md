#### Description

The [NWATREM](#__RefHeading___Toc292511_718033703) keyword defines an extended network node as a point where water is removed from the network, for when the Extended Network option has been activated by the [NETWORK](#__RefHeading___Toc311583_1841740821) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section.  The water to be removed can be specified as a rate or as a fraction of the total volume passing through the node.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

### GCONSUMP – Define Group Gas Consumption and Gas Import Targets


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

GCONSUMP defines the group gas consumption rate either as an actual rate or as a percentage of the group’s production. In both oil and gas fields produced gas is commonly used as fuel to support the processing and utility facilities needed to run the plant.

In addition to defining gas consumption, the keyword can also be used to define the group’s gas import rate, if required. This is used to import gas into the model from other sources (fields, reservoirs etc.) that are not included in the current run. For example, if a several fields are supplying gas to a power plant (field A, B and C), but only one is being modeled in the current import deck (A), then production from the other two fields (B and C) can be incorporated into model in order to meet the plant demand. Note in this case the import gas rates from fields B and C are fixed, and therefore field A acts like a “swing” producer to match the gas demand target.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | Metric | Laboratory |  |
| 1 | GRPNAME | A character string of up to eight characters in length that defines the group name for which the group gas consumption is being defined. The group named FIELD is the top most group and should be used to set the fuel consumption for the field. Note that the group hierarchy should be defined by the GRUPTREE keyword when there is more than one level of groups, otherwise all the groups will sit directly under the FIELD group in the group tree hierarchy. | None |
| 2 | GASFUEL | A real value that defines the gas consumption, that is the fuel gas consumed by the group, either defined as a volumetric rate or as a fraction of the group’s gas production.  The two options are implemented by: This value may be specified using a User Defined Argument (UDA). | 0.0 |
| Mscf/d | sm3/day | scc/hour |  |
| 3 | GASIMP | A real positive value greater than zero that defines the amount of gas to be imported into the group. This value may be specified using a User Defined Argument (UDA). This option is currently not supported by OPM Flow | 0.0 |
| stb/d | sm3/day | scc/hour |  |
| 4 | GASNODE | A character string of up to eight characters in length that defines the network node in the Extended Network Model, for which the fuel gas should be removed (GASFUEL) or the imported gas (GASIMP) assigned. This option is currently not supported by OPM Flow | None |

*Table 12.33: GCONSUMP Keyword Description*


If the group is acting under Group Gas Sales control via the GCONSALE keyword in the SCHEDULE section, then the sales gas is calculated by:


$$
\begin{matrix}\text{Gas Sales Rate} = \text{Total Group Gas Production Rate} \\  - \text{Group Gas Injection Rate} \\  + \text{Total Group Gas Import Rate} \\  - \text{Total Group Gas Consumption}\end{matrix}
$$ {#eq-12-24}


If the group is acting under Group Gas Re-Injection control via the GCONINJE keyword in the SCHEDULE section, then the group gas injection rate calculated by:


$$
\begin{matrix}\text{Group Gas Injection Rate} = \text{Group Gas Injection Rate} \times  \text{Group Re-Injection Fraction} \\  + \text{Total Group Gas Import Rate} \\  - \text{Total Group Gas Consumption}\end{matrix}
$$ {#eq-12-25}


::: {.callout-note}
In oil fields with no gas compression typical values of fuel gas range from three to five percent.

#### Example

The first example sets the fuel gas consumption to 3.0 MMscf/d for the field.


```
--
--       GROUP GAS CONSUMPTION (FUEL) AND IMPORT
--
-- GRUP   GAS      GAS
-- NAME   FUEL    IMPORT
--       ------   -------
GCONSUMP
FIELD    3.0E3                                                                 /
/
```

The second example sets group PLAT-WST’s fuel consumption to be 5% of the platform’s produced gas and group PLAT-EST’s to a constant 1.0 MMscf/d.


```
--
--       GROUP GAS CONSUMPTION (FUEL) AND IMPORT
--
-- GRUP   GAS      GAS
-- NAME   FUEL    IMPORT
--       ------   -------
GCONSUMP
PLAT-WST -0.050                                                                /
PLAT-EST  1.0E3                                                                /
/
```

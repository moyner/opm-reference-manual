#### Description

The [WTEMPQ](#__RefHeading___Toc1127430_4263943340) prints out a user defined selected list of currently defined wells and well lists to the print file (*.PRT). The keyword allows for sub-setting the well names etc., using the normal well and well list naming conventions. For example to list all wells beginning with the characters “OP” then one would use “OP*” as the well name on this keyword.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

#### Description

The WSEGSICD keyword defines a multi-segment well segment to be a spiral Inflow Control Device (“ICD”) as part of a completion for a multi-segment well. Note that the well must have been previously defined by the [WELSPECS](#kw-WELSPECS) and [WELSEGS](#kw-WELSEGS) keywords in the [SCHEDULE](#kw-SCHEDULE) section and that the data for the keyword should be repeated for each multi-segment completion that contains a spiral ICD.

An ICD is a well completion component usually installed along the producing section of a well to minimize the unwanted water and gas breakthrough in an oil well, or early water production in a gas well, due to an uneven flow profile over the completed interval.  Permeability variations over the producing interval cause the high permeability zones to produce higher quantities of fluids than the lower permeability zones and this uneven producing fluid profile may result in bypassed hydrocarbons. Secondly, for horizontal wells, the pressure loss from the “toe” to the “heel” of the well again results in an uneven fluid profile over the producing interval. In order to rectify this ICDs can be installed so that the well fluids have to flow through an ICD before entering the tubing; thus, creating an additional “designed” pressure loss.

A spiral ICD is a type of frictional ICD that adds an additional pressure loss by directing the fluid along a “channel” (spiral/helix) before entering the tubing. The channel flow path is designed in such a manner as to create the desired pressure loss for a given ICD.   By placing various ICD’s over the production interval one can design a completion that results in a more uniform producing fluid profile throughout the length of the producing interval.

: WSEGSICD Keyword Description {#tbl-12-120}
The total number of wells should be defined via the [WELLDIMS](#kw-WELLDIMS) keyword and the number of multi-segment wells should be declared on the [WSEGDIMS](#kw-WSEGDIMS) keyword, both keywords are in the [RUNSPEC](#kw-RUNSPEC) section. In addition, the [WELSPECS](#kw-WELSPECS) keyword should be used to define wells, the [COMPDAT](#kw-COMPDAT) keyword to define the well completions for both ordinary wells and multi-segment wells, and the [COMPSEGS](#kw-COMPSEGS) keyword to define a multi-segment segment completions. Finally, the WSEGSICD keyword can then be use to define ICD connections for the well. All the aforementioned keywords are described in the [SCHEDULE](#kw-SCHEDULE) section.


The equations used to calculate the pressure drop across the ICD are given below and illustrate how the pressure reduction is dependent on the density and viscosity of the fluid flowing through the device.


$$
\mathrm{Δ}P = {(\frac{{\mathrm{ρ}}_{\mathit{calibrated}}}{{\mathrm{ρ}}_{\mathit{mixture}}}⋅\frac{{\mathrm{μ}}_{\mathit{mixture}}}{{\mathrm{μ}}_{\mathit{calibrated}}})}^{\frac{1}{4}}⋅ \frac{{\mathrm{ρ}}_{\mathit{mixture}}}{{\mathrm{ρ}}_{\mathit{calibrated}}} ⋅ \mathrm{β} ⋅ {q}^{2}
$$ {#eq-12-39}

Where:

ΔP	=  the pressure drop across the device.

ρmixture	=  the density of the mixture, as per:


$$
{\mathrm{ρ}}_{\mathit{mixture}} = ({\mathrm{α}}_{\mathit{oil}} ⋅ {\mathrm{ρ}}_{\mathit{oil}}) + ({\mathrm{α}}_{\mathit{wat}} ⋅ {\mathrm{ρ}}_{\mathit{wat}}) + ({\mathrm{α}}_{\mathit{gas}} ⋅ {\mathrm{ρ}}_{\mathit{gas}})
$$ {#eq-12-40}


ρcalibrated	=  CALDEN, the density of the calibrating fluid at surface conditions.

μcalibrated	=  CALVISC, the viscosity of the calibrating fluid at surface conditions.

μmixture	=  the viscosity of the mixture, as per:


$$
{\mathrm{μ}}_{\mathit{mixture}} = ({\mathrm{α}}_{\mathit{oil}} + {\mathrm{α}}_{\mathit{wat}}) ⋅ {\mathrm{μ}}_{\mathit{emulsion}} + ({\mathrm{α}}_{\mathit{gas}} ⋅ {\mathrm{μ}}_{\mathit{gas}})
$$ {#eq-12-41}


μemulsion	=  the viscosity of the oil-water emulsion at local conditions.

β	=  ICDSTREN, the strength of the ICD as measured using the calibrated fluid.

q	=  the local flow rate through the ICD at local conditions adjusted for scaling

based on ICDLEN and NSCALFAC parameters in @tbl-12-120.


In equation (12.40), αi represents the volume fraction of oil, water and gas at local conditions and ρi the density of the three phases. Similarity for equation (12.41), αi represents the volume fraction of oil, water and gas at local conditions and μi the viscosity of the three phases.

See also the [WSEGAICD](#kw-WSEGAICD) keyword in the [SCHEDULE](#kw-SCHEDULE) section for autonomous ICDs, that work in a similar fashion to how sprial ICDs work.


#### Example

The following example defines one producing well segment oil well (OP01) using the [WELSPECS](#kw-WELSPECS), [WELSEGS](#kw-WELSEGS) [COMPDAT](#kw-COMPDAT) and [COMPSEGS](#kw-COMPSEGS) keywords, followed by the WSEGSICD keyword to define the spiral inflow control devices for the well.

Branch number two uses one ICD for segments seven to ten, branch number three again uses only one  ICD for segments 12 to 15 and similarly branch number three uses one ICD. The fifth and final branch has a total of four ICDs with the last interval having a 10 foot length.  Since NSCALFAC equals two for the ICDs, then the scale factor is equal to the length of ICDLEN, divided by the total length of the completions which supply the ICD.  Where ICDLEN is defaulted, the default value of 39.37 ft will be used for field units and 12 m for SI units.

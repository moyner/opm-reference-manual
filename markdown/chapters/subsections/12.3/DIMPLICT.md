#### Description

This keyword, [DIMPLICT](#__RefHeading___Toc179100_1772380413), activates the Fully Implicit Formulation and results in the simulator switching from the current solution formulation to the fully implicit formulation. OPM Flow uses a different numerical scheme which makes this keyword redundant; hence, OPM Flow ignores this keyword. It is documented here for completeness.

There is no data required for this keyword.

See section [2.2](#2.2.Running OPM Flow 2018-10 |outline)[ ](#2.2.Running OPM Flow 2018-10 |outline)[Running OPM Flow 2023-04 From The Command Line](#2.2.Running OPM Flow 2018-10 |outline) on how to invoke various numerical schemes via the OPM Flow command line interface.


#### Example


```
--
--       ACTIVATES THE FULLY IMPLICIT SOLUTION OPTION
--
DIMPLICT

```

The above example switches on the fully implicit solution option; however, this has no effect in OPM Flow input decks.

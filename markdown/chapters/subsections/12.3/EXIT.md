### EXIT – Exit Simulation from within an Action Section


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The EXIT keyword is part of OPM Flow’s ACTION facility that allows for terminating the simulation for when a condition within an ACTIONX definition is satisfied.  Invoking the keyword within an ACTIONX definition will result in the simulation terminating with an exit status code. The ACTION facility allows the user to enter computational logic to the simulation run based on the how the simulation run is proceeding – see the ACTIONX keyword in the SCHEDULE section.


| Note This is an OPM Flow specific keyword for the simulator’s ACTION facility and will therefore cause an error if used in the commercial simulator. |

| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | EXITCODE | An optional integer that sets the exit code printed to the *.PRT file, if not not defined the default value of zero will be used. | 0 |
| Notes: |  |  |  |

*Table 12.25: EXIT Keyword Description*


The EXIT keyword should only be used as part of an ACTIONX block, if found elsewhere in the input deck it will be ignored.


#### Examples

The first example uses the ACTIONX keyword to define a condition for when the Field Oil Production Rate (“FOPR) falls below 1,000 stb/d (or 1,000 m3) using the default value for the EXITCODE.


```
--
--       DEFINE START OF ACTIONX SECTION
--
ACTIONX
         'CHECK_FOPR' 100000            /
         FOPR < 1000                    /
/
--
--       TERMINATE AND EXIT SIMULATION
--
EXIT
                                        /

ENDACTIO

```

The next example terminates the simulation with EXITCODE one when the Field Pressure (“FPR”) falls below 200 psia (or 200 barsa).


```
--
--       DEFINE START OF ACTIONX SECTION
--
ACTIONX
         'CHECK_FPR'  100000             /
          FPR < 200                      /
/
--
--       TERMINATE AND EXIT SIMULATION
--
EXIT
         1                               /

ENDACTIO
```


Note is is probably good practice to always set the EXITCODE to be able to identify the reason for the simulation stopping.

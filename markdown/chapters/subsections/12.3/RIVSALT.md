### RIVSALT – Define River Upstream Flow Salt Concentrations


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The RIVSALT keyword defines the injected salt concentration in individual river branches in a previously characterized river system using the RIVERSYS and the REACHES keywords in the SCHEDULE section.  The River option must be activated via the RIVRDIMS keyword in the RUNSPEC section in order to use this keyword.  In addition, the Brine option must also be enabled via the BRINE keyword in the RUNSPEC section.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

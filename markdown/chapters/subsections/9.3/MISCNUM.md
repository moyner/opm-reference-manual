### MISCNUM – Define the Miscibility Region Numbers {#kw-MISCNUM}

#### Description

The MISCNUM keyword defines the miscibility region number mixing tables as defined by the [TLMIXPAR](#kw-TLMIXPAR) keyword in the [PROPS](#kw-PROPS) section, for when the miscibility option has been activated by the [MISCIBLE](#kw-MISCIBLE) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#kw-RUNSPEC) section. MISCNUM also allocates miscible residual oil saturation versus water saturation tables ([SORWMIS](#kw-SORWMIS) keyword in the [PROPS](#kw-PROPS) section) used to calculate the relative permeability and PVT properties for a grid cell.

Note that although this keyword can only be used when the miscibility option is active, it is not necessary to use this keyword even if the [MISCIBLE](#kw-MISCIBLE) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#kw-RUNSPEC) has been activated as the default value of one will be applied to all grid blocks. Secondly, a value of zero for a grid cell results in immiscible fluids in that grid cell.

| 1 | MISCNUM | MISCNUM defines an array of positive integers greater than or equal to zero, that assign a grid cell to a particular table of mixing parameters as defined by the [TLMIXPAR](#kw-TLMIXPAR) and [SORWMIS](#kw-SORWMIS) keywords. A value of zero sets the fluids within a grid cell to be immiscible. The maximum number of MISCNUM regions is set by the NTMIS variable on the [MISCIBLE](#kw-MISCIBLE) keyword in the [RUNSPEC](#kw-RUNSPEC) section. | 1 |

#### Example

The example below sets three MISCNUM regions in the model on a layer by layer basis, using the [EQUALS](#kw-EQUALS) keyword.

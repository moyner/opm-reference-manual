### DATUMR – Define Datum Depths for the FIPNUM Regions


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The DATUMR keyword defines the datum depth for each fluid in-place region (FIPNUM) declared in the model. This allows for all grid block potentials (depth corrected pressures) to be calculated at a common depth within a FIPNUM region.

*Table 10.12: DATUMR Keyword Description*


See also the DATUM and DATUMRX keywords in the SOLUTION section that also define the datum depth for the model.


#### Example


```
--
--       DATUM
--       DEPTH
--       ------
DATUMR
         4800.0
         4900.0
         5000.0                                      / DATUM DEPTH FOR REPORTING
```


The above example defines the datum depth for three FIPNUM regions, for when NTFIP has been set equal to three on the REGDIMS keyword in the RUNSPEC section.

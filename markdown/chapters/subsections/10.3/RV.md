### RV – Define the Initial Equilibration CGR (Rv) for All Grid Blocks


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The RV keyword defines the initial equilibration vaporized oil-gas ratio values for all grid cells in the model and should be used in conjunction with the PBUB, PDEW, PRESSURE, RS, SGAS, SOIL and SWAT keywords etc., to fully describe the initial state of the model. The keyword should only be used if vaporized oil been activated in the model via the VAPOIL keyword in the RUNSPEC section.

This is the non-standard method to initialize the model via enumeration and is seldom employed in the industry. The standard methodology is for OPM Flow to initialize a model using the parameters on the EQUIL keyword combined with other keywords to fully describe the initial state of the model.  The keyword can be used with all grid types.

| 1 | RV | RV is an array of real positive numbers assigning the initial equilibration vaporized oil-gas ratio values to each cell in the model. Repeat counts may be used, for example 20*0.00720 | None |

See also the PBUB, PDEW, PRESSURE, RS, SGAS, SOIL and SWAT keywords to fully define the initial state of the model.


#### Example


```
--
--       DEFINE INITIAL EQUILIBRATION CGR VALUES FOR ALL CELLS IN THE MODEL
--       BASED ON NX = 100, NY = 100 AND NZ = 3
--
RV
         1000*0.00720   1000*0.00725   1000*0.00730                            /

```

The above example defines the initial equilibration GOR values to be 0.00720 for all the cells in the first layer, 0.00725 for all the cells in the second layer, and finally 0.00730 for all the cells in the third layer.

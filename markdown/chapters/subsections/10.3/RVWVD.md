### RVWVD – Equilibration Vaporized Water-Gas Ratio (Rvw) versus Depth Tables


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The RVWVD keyword defines the vaporized water-gas ratio (Rvw) versus depth tables for each equilibration region that should be used when there is vaporized water in the model and the EQLOPT6 variable has been set to a positive integer on the EQUIL keyword in the SOLUTION section.

The keyword should only be used if both gas and water phases haves been activated in the model via the GAS and WATER keywords, and the VAPWAT is also present activating OPM Flow’s Vaporized Water Model. All the aforementioned keywords are in the RUNSPEC section.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | Metric | Laboratory |  |
| 1 | DEPTH | A columnar vector of real monotonically increasing down the column   values that defines the depth values for the corresponding vaporized oil-gas ratio values, RVW | None |
| feet | m | cm |  |
| 2 | RVW | A columnar vector of real values that defines the vaporized water-gas ratio values,  values at the corresponding DEPTH. | None |
| stb/Mscf | sm3/sm3 | scc/scc |  |
| Notes: |  |  |  |

*Table 10.35: RVWVD Keyword Description*

Alternatively, the vaporized water-gas ratio for each cell may be set via the RVW keyword in the SOLUTION section, if the non-standard method to initialize the model via enumeration is being employed.

See also the EQUIL keywords in the SOLUTION section.


| Note This is an OPM Flow specific keyword for the simulator’s Water Vaporization Model that is activated by declaring that vaporized water is present in the run using the VAPWAT keyword in the RUNSPEC section. Use the command line option --enable-opm-rst-file=true to output the RVW data to the RESTART file. |

#### Example

Given NTEQUL equals three and NDRXVD is greater than or equal to two on the EQLDIMS keyword in the RUNSPEC section, then the following example defines the vaporized water-gas ratio versus depth functions.


```
--
--       DEPTH    RVW
--                STB/MSCF
--       ------   --------
RVWVD
         3000.0   0.00000
         8000.0   0.00000                            / RVW VS DEPTH EQUIL REGN 01
--       ------   --------
         3000.0   0.00000
         8000.0   0.00000                            / RVW VS DEPTH EQUIL REGN 02
--       ------   --------
         3000.0   0.00100
         8000.0   0.00100                            / RVW VS DEPTH EQUIL REGN 03
```


The example shows three tables for three regions with constant RVW versus depth relationships for each equilibration region, with the first two tables having a zero vaporized water-gas ratio and the last region having a constant 0.001 stb/Mscf versus depth relationship.

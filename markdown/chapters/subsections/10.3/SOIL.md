### SOIL – Define the Initial Equilibration Oil Saturation for All Grid Blocks


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

The SOIL keyword defines the initial equilibration oil saturation values for all grid cells in the model and should be used in conjunction with the PBUB, PDEW, PRESSURE, RS, RV, SGAS and SWAT keywords etc., to fully describe the initial state of the model. The keyword should only be used if the oil phase has been activated in the model via the OIL keyword in the RUNSPEC section.

This is the non-standard method to initialize the model via enumeration and is seldom employed in the industry. The standard methodology is for OPM Flow to initialize a model using the parameters on the EQUIL keyword combined with other keywords to fully describe the initial state of the model.  The keyword can be used with all grid types.

| 1 | SOIL | SOIL is an array of real positive numbers that are greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to one assigning the initial equilibration oil saturation values to each cell in the model. Repeat counts may be used, for example 20*0.600. | None |

*Table 10.47: SOIL Keyword Description*


Note for two phase runs it is only necessary to enter one saturation array of one of the phases present in the run (SGAS, SOIL, or SWAT), as the simulator will calculate the other phases by difference. Similarly for three phase runs it is only necessary to enter the array data for two of the phases, as the third saturation will again be calculated by the simulator.

See also the PBUB, PDEW, PRESSURE, RS, RV, SGAS and SWAT keywords to fully define the initial state of the model.


#### Example


```
--
--       DEFINE INITIAL EQUILIBRATION OIL SAT VALUES FOR ALL CELLS IN THE MODEL
--       BASED ON NX = 100, NY = 100 AND NZ = 3
--
SOIL
         1000*0.7000    1000*0.6500    1000*0.6000                             /

```

The above example defines the initial equilibration oil saturation values to be 0.7000 for all the cells in the first layer, 0.6500 for all the cells in the second layer, and finally 0.6000 for all the cells in the third layer.

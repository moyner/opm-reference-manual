#### Description

The [AQUFET](#__RefHeading___Toc197384_1310555686) keyword defines Fetkovich [Fetkovich, M. J. “A Simplified Approach to Water Influx Calculations - Finite Aquifer Systems,” Journal of Petroleum Technology, (1971) 23, No. 7, 814-828.] analytical aquifers, the aquifer properties, together with the cell connections to the aquifer. Each row entry in the [AQUFETP](#__RefHeading___Toc4428_421927891) keyword defines one Fetkovich analytical aquifer and one cell face to be connected to the aquifer.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped; however, see the [AQUFETP](#__RefHeading___Toc4428_421927891) keyword in the [SOLUTION](#__RefHeading___Toc43947_784232322) section and [AQUANCON](#__RefHeading___Toc177536_3429068809) keyword in the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) section, on how to define and connect Fetkovich analytical aquifers.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | Metric | Laboratory |  |
| 1 | DATUM | DATUM is a single positive value that defines the Fetkovich reference datum depth for PRESS. | None |
| feet | m | cm |  |
| 2 | PRESS | PRESS is a single positive value that defines the aquifer pressure at DATUM. If PRESS is defaulted then the simulator will set the aquifer’s initial reservoir pressure to be in equilibrium with the cells the aquifer is contacted to. Defaulting this parameter will avoid inconsistent equilibration pressures between the reservoir cells and the aquifer. | 1* |

| 6 | [PVTW](#__RefHeading___Toc2086106_3315222525) | A positive integer that defines the aquifer’s [PVTW](#__RefHeading___Toc2086106_3315222525) water property table. | 1 |
| 7 | I1 | A positive integer that defines the lower bound of the cells in the I-direction to be connected to the aquifer and must be greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to I2 and NX. | 1 |
| 8 | I2 | A positive integer that defines the upper bound of the cells in the I-direction to be connected to the aquifer and must be greater than or equal to I1 and less than or equal to NX | NX |
| 9 | J1 | A positive integer that defines the lower bound of the cells in the J-direction to be connected to the aquifer and must be greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to J2 and NY. | 1 |

| 12 | K2 | A positive integer that defines the upper bound of the cells in the K-direction to be connected to the aquifer and must be greater than or equal to KI and less than or equal to NZ. | NZ |
| 13 | AQUFACE | AQUFACE is a character string that sets the connection “face” of the cells declared by this record and should be set to one of the following: | None |
| 14 | SALTCON | SALTCON is a real positive number that defines the initial salt concentration in the aquifer. This variable is ignored by OPM Flow. | 0.0 |
| lb/stb | kg/sm3 | gm/scc |  |

*Table 10.7: AQUFET Keyword Description*


Note this keyword should only be used in equilibration and enumerated initialize runs, that is it should be omitted from [RESTART](#__RefHeading___Toc135629_1317547213) runs.


| Note If the model is unstable then this may be due to an aquifer not being in equilibrium with the connecting reservoir blocks, for example the aquifer is connected to only hydrocarbon reservoir cells. Try commenting out the aquifer and see if this resolves the instabilities. |

#### Example

Given the following grid and aquifer dimensions in the [RUNSPEC](#__RefHeading___Toc55591_1778172979) section:

The Fetkovich Analytical aquifer is defined in the [SOLUTION](#__RefHeading___Toc43947_784232322) sections as:


```

Here one Fetkovich Analytical aquifer is connected to a single cell (1, 1, 1) at the J- face (or X- face) of the grid.

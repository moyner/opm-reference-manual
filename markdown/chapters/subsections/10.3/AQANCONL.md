#### Description

The AQANCON keyword defines how analytical aquifers are connected to a Local Grid Refinement ("LGR") grid, this includes the Carter-Tracy, Fetkovich and Constant Flux analytical aquifers, all of which are implemented in OPM Flow.  Carter-Tracy analytical aquifers are characterized by the [AQUCT](#__RefHeading___Toc179876_3429068809) keyword in the [GRID](#__RefHeading___Toc38674_784232322) section and Fetkovich analytical aquifers are defined by either the [AQUFET](#__RefHeading___Toc197384_1310555686) or [AQUFETP](#__RefHeading___Toc4428_421927891) keywords in the [SOLUTION](#__RefHeading___Toc43947_784232322) section. Finally, the Constant Flux aquifer is defined by the [AQUFLUX](#__RefHeading___Toc202105_1310555686) keyword in [SOLUTION](#__RefHeading___Toc43947_784232322) section.

This keyword is not supported by OPM Flow but would change the results if supported so the simulation will be stopped.

| 6 | J2 | A positive integer that defines the LGR's upper bound of the cells in the J-direction to be connected to the aquifer, and must be greater than or equal to JI and less than or equal to NY on the [CARFIN](#__RefHeading___Toc150726_63720426) keyword for Cartesian grids. | NY |
| 7 | K1 | A positive integer that defines the LGR's lower bound of the cells in the K-direction to be to be connected to the aquifer, and must be greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to K2 and NZ on the [CARFIN](#__RefHeading___Toc150726_63720426) keyword for Cartesian grids. | 1 |
| 8 | K2 | A positive integer that defines the LGR's upper bound of the cells in the K-direction to be connected to the aquifer, and must be greater than or equal to KI and less than or equal to NZ on the [CARFIN](#__RefHeading___Toc150726_63720426) keyword for Cartesian grids. | NZ |

| 10 | [AQUFLUX](#__RefHeading___Toc202105_1310555686) | [AQUFLUX](#__RefHeading___Toc202105_1310555686) is a positive real value that sets the fraction of the total influx between the aquifer and the defined cells declared on this keyword. If defaulted the cell face for each cell is applied and if a values is declared then this values is applied to all cells declared by this record. | 1* |
| ft2 | m2 | cm2 |  |
| 11 | AQUCOEF | AQUCOEF is a real positive values that scales the calculated connection between the aquifer and the cells declared on this record. | 1.0 |
| dimensionless | dimensionless | dimensionless |  |
| 12 | AQUOPT | AQUOPT is a character string that sets the cell face connection and should be set to one of the following: | NO |

*Table 10.6: AQANCONL Keyword Description*


| Note If the [AQANCONL](#__RefHeading___Toc177536_342906880911111) keyword has been utilized in the run deck then OPM Flow will write the  AQUIFERA array to the *.INIT file in order to visualize the aquifer connections in OPM ResInsight. This is accomplished by setting the AQUIFERA value to 2(AQUID-1) for cells connected to aquifer AQUID. If a cell is connected to multiple analytical aquifers then AQUIFERA is summed for all aquifers connected to a cell. Note that connecting cells to multiple aquifers is best avoided. |

#### Example

The following example defines aquifer number one connected to the J- face of various cells in the LGROP001 [LGR](#__RefHeading___Toc55049_4106839650), and a second basal aquifer connected to the K+ face.

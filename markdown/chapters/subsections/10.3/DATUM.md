*Table 10.11: DATUM Keyword Description*


See also the DATUMR and DATUMRX keywords in the SOLUTION section that also define the datum depth for the model.


#### Example


```
--       DATUM
--       DEPTH
--       ------
DATUM
         5000.0                                      / DATUM DEPTH FOR REPORTING

```

The above example defines the datum for the model to be 5000.0

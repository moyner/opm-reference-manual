### TEMPVD – Define the Initial Reservoir Temperature versus Depth Tables


| RUNSPEC | GRID | EDIT | PROPS | REGIONS | SOLUTION | SUMMARY | SCHEDULE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


#### Description

This keyword defines the initial reservoir temperature versus depth tables for each equilibration region. Note that the TEMPVD keyword is an alias for RTEMPVD, and that both keywords are supported by OPM Flow, in both the PROPS and SOLUTION sections, but are treated as being mutually exclusive.

The initial reservoir temperature must be defined when OPM Flow’s thermal option has been activated by the THERMAL keyword in the RUNSPEC section. Note this is different to the commercial simulator that uses the TEMP keyword in the RUNSPEC section to activate the black-oil temperature model, and the THERMAL keyword to activate the compositional thermal model.

The initial reservoir temperature should be defined when OPM Flow’s CO2 or H2 storage option has been activated by the CO2STORE or [H2STORE](#REF_HEADING_KEYWORD_H2STORE) keyword in the RUNSPEC section.


| No. | Name | Description | Default |

| Field | Metric | Laboratory |  |
| 1 | DEPTH | A columnar vector of real monotonically increasing down the column   values that defines the depth for corresponding reservoir temperature parameter RTEMP. | None |
| feet | m | cm |  |
| 2 | RTEMP | A columnar vector of real monotonically increasing down the column values that defines the corresponding reservoir temperature for the given depth. | None |

See also the RTEMP keyword in the PROPS section for an alternative way to define a uniform initial reservoir temperature.


#### Example


```
--
--       INITIAL RESERVOIR TEMPERATURE VERSUS DEPTH TABLE
--
TEMPVD
--       DEPTH    TEMPERATURE
--       FEET     DEG F
--       ------   ----------
         1000.0     90.000
         2000.0    100.000
         3000.0    130.000
         4000.0    160.000                                 / TABLE N0. 01
--       ------   ----------
         1000.0     90.000
         2000.0    100.000
         3000.0    130.000
         4000.0    160.000                                 / TABLE N0. 02
--       ------   ----------
         1000.0     90.000
         2000.0    100.000
         3000.0    130.000
         4000.0    160.000                                 / TABLE N0. 03
```


The above example defines three identical reservoir depth versus temperature tables for the three NTEQUL regions defined on the EQLDIMS keyword in the RUNSPEC section.

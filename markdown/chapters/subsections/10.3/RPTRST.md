#### Description

This keyword defines the data to be written to the [RESTART](#__RefHeading___Toc135629_1317547213) file and the frequency at which restart points will be created. In addition to the solution data arrays required to restart a run, the user may request extra data to be written to the restart file for visualization in OPM ResInsight.

The [RPTRST](#__RefHeading___Toc210154_2884651453) keyword should be followed by a series of character strings that indicate the data to be written. In most cases the character string is the keyword used to load the data in the OPM Flow input deck, for example [KRG](#__RefHeading___Toc97393_621662414) for the gas relative permeability of each grid block at the requested times. It is anticipated that OPM Flow will support additional functionality as development progresses.

*Table 10.26: RPTRST Keyword Description*


Note, older versions of the commercial simulator used integer values to control the output to the [RESTART](#__RefHeading___Toc135629_1317547213) file, this type of format is not supported by OPM Flow and thus the integers should be converted to the mnemonic format as outlined in Table 10.26.

*Table 10.27: Data Sets Automatically Written to the RESTART File*


| Note Currently, OPM Flow distinguishes between those arrays which are required for restarting a run and those which are "merely" for visualization and analysis. However, this classification is imperfect and leads to potentially exporting arrays that are incompatible with the commercial simulator, such as the [TEMP](#__RefHeading___Toc146397_3544483072) array in non-thermal simulation runs. If one is willing to forego the ability to restart an OPM Flow simulation run, using the commercial simulator, e.g., simulating the historic period using OPM Flow and the prediction period using the commercial simulator, then additional arrays are available, including the [PBUB](#__RefHeading___Toc135619_1317547213) and [PDEW](#__RefHeading___Toc135623_1317547213) vectors generated by the PBPD option, by using the following command line option: --enable-opm-rst-file=true |

If the --enable-opm-rst-file=true command line option has been specified then the following OPM Flow specific data are also automatically output for visualization only as outlined in the table below:


| No. | Mnemonic | Description | Array Name |

#### Examples

The first example request that the standard restart data be written out every month.


```
--
--       RESTART CONTROL BASIC = 4 (YEARLY) 5 (MONTHLY)
--
RPTRST
         BASIC=5                                                               /

```

The next example requests that the standard restart data be written at every report time step until this switch is reset and all the restarts are kept. In addition to the standard the data the gas, oil and water relative permeability data will also be written out at each report time step.


```
--
--       RESTART CONTROL BASIC = 4 (YEARLY) 5 (MONTHLY)
--
RPTRST
         BASIC=2  KRG   KRO   KRW                                             /

```
